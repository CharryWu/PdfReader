The present volume 
is a result of a conference, 
‘Rethinking 
culture in the Ottoman eighteenth century’, which took place in 
Princeton on 15–16 January 2005. Although a very large number 
of excellent proposals were submitted in response to the call for 
papers, all things being equal, priority of participation was given 
to junior/graduate students and international scholars. After the 
conclusion of the conference, a committee of five senior and 
junior scholars was 
formed 
for 
the purpose of selecting 
the 
conference papers to be published. Once chosen, the papers were 
sent out for anonymous peer review and subsequently revised by 
the authors. Thus, this volume is the end result of a long process 
that could not have been completed without the work and dedi-
cation of a number of colleagues.  
Given 
the multilinguistic 
legacy of 
the Ottoman Empire, 
however, no attempt has been made to privilege any one of the 
relevant Middle Eastern 
languages 
in terms of transliteration, 
especially with regard to shared terms between Arabic, Persian 
and Ottoman. Similarly, the choice of rendering titles and names 
into English or Turkish has been left to the individual authors. 
I offer my first consignment of gratitude to Michael Cook, who 
invited me ‘to organize a conference on the eighteenth century’. 
To that end, he entrusted me with some of his Mellon Foundation 
grant funds with no strings attached. He interfered in neither 
conceptualization nor logistics; however, he always came through

whenever his support was needed. In short, he proved to be the 
ideal patron. 
At Princeton, Şukru Hanioğlu generously offered funds from 
the M. Munir Ertegün Foundation to cover some outstanding 
expenses. Kathy O’Neil gave her indispensible administrative help 
and Kim Hegelbach enthusiastically shared her knowledge of the 
nooks and crannies of the university campus and bureaucracy. 
Relief 
from 
constant organizing 
and busy deliberation was 
provided by the tradition of Tuesday dinners with the happy 
company of Shahab Ahmed, Yossi Rappoport and Gilat Levy. 
Through the duration of the conference and beyond, I benefited 
from the advice and support of various scholars. I thank Norman 
Itzkowitz and Rifacat Abou-El-Haj for sharing their wisdom, and 
Elizabeth Frierson for a stellar performance at the conference and 
after. Immense gratitude is due to Madeline Zilfi for so kindly 
investing in this project time and work well beyond the call of 
duty. For their work behind the scenes, I am grateful to Heghnar

I also thank the individual contributors to this volume for being

Decline, its Discontents and 
Ottoman Cultural History: By 
Way of Introduction 

Dana Sajdi 

Those who have not been keeping careful track of recent 
monographs in Ottoman history, the time has come to stop 
and take notice. … Dina Rizk Khouri’s study … joins the 
monographs 
of Çızakça, Darling, 
Fahmy, Hathaway, 
Hickok, Hoexter, Salzmann, Todorova and Zeɔevi … adds 
to the earlier studies (but all since 1980) of scholars such 
as Abou-El-Haj, Aksan, Barkey, Cohen, Cuno, Doumani, 
Faroqhi, Kunt, Marcus, and Toledano … these works in 
aggregate have made obsolete all discussion of Ottoman stasis 
in the period from the death of Suleiman I in 1566 to the 
reform era 
initiated by Selim III 
in the 
late eighteenth 
century. Those who persist 
in portraying 
those 
interim 
centuries as a 
time of decline, Ottoman 
ineptitude, and 
weakness … do so out of sheer laziness. Read together, the 
works mentioned portray an empire whose 
leadership 
continually 
adjusted methods of 
taxation, 
assessment, 
landholding, revenue-holding, and military formations in 
an attempt to respond to the changing circumstances and 
demands of the empire for money or military might.1 

This excerpt from a book review by Amy Singer published in 
1999 warrants several observations. Mirroring the general state of 

1

the 
field of Ottoman studies on the period between the 
late 
sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the monographs cited 
above are characterized by an overwhelming collective concern to 
topple a single problematic, namely the ‘decline thesis’. The listed 
works also reflect the manner in which the decline thesis was 
tackled, that is by focusing on the Ottoman state in order to 
demonstrate the ability of the state to adapt to changing circum-
stances, and by writing Ottoman provincial histories within the 
sub-disciplines of social history, economic history and political 
economy to show transformations in the polity, economy and 
society symptomatic of 
indigenous moves towards modernity. 
Culture, however, is decidedly absent both as an object of study, 
and as a method of analysis.  
The present volume contains studies in Ottoman culture of 
which the temporal scope converges on the eighteenth century 
with necessary glances backwards and forwards into the period 
between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. While the focus 
on culture in each chapter is a response to a deliberate call by the 
editor, the topics and methods are not. The relative uniformity of 
the topics covered 
in this volume, which deal with either a 
deconstruction of the history and historiography of the so-called 
‘Tulip Period’ (roughly, the first three decades of the Ottoman 
eighteenth century), or the rethinking and characterization of the 
institution of the coffee house, is itself indicative of the direction 
that the field is taking. Conceptually and methodologically, there 
is an implicit leitmotif that informs the chapters as a collective – 
namely, the social and political uses of cultural products and 
institutions ranging from architecture to ritual, to coffee houses, 
to the printing press and to historiography itself. Later on in this 
essay, we will have the opportunity to locate these studies within 
the new field of Ottoman cultural history; for now, it suffices to 
mention that this volume is one of the first collective treatments 
to focus on culture and thus seeks to add culture to the study of 
Ottoman early modernity. 
The historiography of Ottoman early modernity has been 
almost 
intractably entangled 
in 
the overarching dialectic of 

2 

"
13,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

‘decline/anti-decline’. Within the folds of the dialectic of decline 
and its anti is a long history of epistemological (and political) 
complications. By now one can comfortably state that, at least in 
the academy and specifically within Ottoman studies, the decline 
thesis has been overwhelmingly and successfully discredited. 
Thus, 
if one were to provide a quick characterization of the 
location of the present volume in the field, it would be between 
the tail end of anti-decline scholarship and the emerging field of 
cultural history. The obvious question is, therefore, is there a 
relationship between the rise of cultural history and the near 
closure of anti-decline scholarship?  
This question is one of the issues that will be raised here. 
However, to address it I take this opportunity to devote much of 
this introduction to anti-decline scholarship, with the aim of 
exposing and thematizing its contributions. This will not only 
shed light on the circumstances surrounding the subsequent rise 
of Ottoman cultural history, but will serve to provide the widest 
possible context in which to locate, and appreciate, the contri-
butions of the current volume. While the reader will find here 
the accustomed brief introduction to the various chapters (in 
the section entitled ‘Tulips and coffee houses’ below), the gen-
eral thrust of this chapter is to acknowledge the contributions of 
the scholarship 
in 
the past 25 years, while simultaneously 
sketching rough contours of the state of the field.2 Since the 
geographical coverage of 
the 
contributions 
to 
this volume 
overlap on the imperial centre, Istanbul, and the provinces of 
Damascus and Egypt, the majority of the scholarship reviewed 
here will be about these areas.  
In the first section I delineate the decline thesis along with its 
theoretical and paradigmatic bases. The section 
following 
is 
devoted to the effort to dismantle the category of decline start-
ing from the earliest calls in the late 1950s, but focusing on 
scholarship in the 1980s and 1990s. In this part I shall review 
the different frameworks and theories that were advanced in 
place of the decline thesis by exposing one or more salient 
studies in each of the fields of political economy, economic 

3

history, state formation studies, gender studies, urban social 
history and intellectual history. I then approach the emergence 
of Ottoman 
cultural history by 
exploring 
the 
attitudes of 
modern scholars towards the text and using the example of 
recent studies on textural production and book history. I will do 
so by asking two questions. The first, asked above, has to do 
with whether there is a relationship between the rise of cultural 
history and the end of anti-decline scholarship, and the second 
attempts to explore the enabling effect anti-decline scholarship 
has had on cultural history. In the fourth section I introduce the 
studies 
in 
this volume, while 
in 
the epilogue I 
temper 
the 
general optimistic 
tone by 
asking whether 
in 
the 
current 
political atmosphere it is really possible to dismantle the decline 
thesis and to transcend Eurocentricism. 

The category of decline 

Since the eighteenth century, first European observers and then 
academics have employed the notion of ‘decline’ to describe the 
post-sixteenth-century Ottoman condition. This notion, popping 
up in different guises, the most familiar of which is the ‘sick man 
of Europe’, while initially used to explain the military setbacks, 
territorial contraction and/or economic deterioration of the Otto-
man empire, came to represent an overarching category that 
subsumed every aspect of society, polity and culture.3 This rather 
comprehensively damning view of 
the Ottoman sixteenth 
to 
nineteenth centuries, resembling the attitude to the premodern 
histories of many regions that came under colonial rule, served 
the purposes of, or perhaps was propelled by, a Western hege-
monic agenda. This view fitted neatly into Enlightenment pro-
gress discourse, coalesced in Orientalist scholarship, and acquired 
further academic rigour 
in 
formulations such as the Marxian 
‘Asiatic mode of production’ 
and 
‘Oriental despotism’, 
and 
Weberian-inspired modernizationist and developmentist theories. 
The process of the epistemological consolidation and academic 
legitimation of such Eurocentric and imperialist views has been 
sufficiently delineated, and need not delay us here.4 However, a 

4 

"
15,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

‘Ottoman 

brief outline of the meanings and manifestations of 
decline’ is necessary.  
The category of decline assumes an isolated and unique Islamic 
society/civilization, which, because of its essential difference, is 
not 
susceptible 
to meaningful 
comparison. 
This 
society/ 
civilization functioned according to its own particular institutions 
and 
ideals. Though 
successful during 
the 
‘Golden Age’ of 
Süleyman 
the Magnificent, Ottoman 
society/civilization 
soon 
witnessed a decay of its institutions and a woeful departure from 
its ideals. Incapable of adapting to changing circumstances or 
technological innovations, both the Ottoman state and society 
remained 
unchanged, 
insisting 
on 
rigid 
traditionalism 
and 
retaining decayed institutions, thus receding on the civilizational 
scale into a backward stage. Deliverance – read modernity – came 
in the form of the ‘impact of the West’, injecting or inspiring 
reform and paving 
the way 
for modern nationalisms. Con-
sequently, the dates fixed to demarcate Middle Eastern modernity 
are the Napoleonic invasion with regard to Egypt (1798), the first 
wave of Zionist migrations in Palestine (1882) or the Egyptian 
invasion 
of 
the 
Levant 
(1831), 
and 
the Western-inspired 
Tanzimat (1839–76) for the rest of the empire.  
A host of 
indications are cited 
in support of 
the 
foregoing 
conceptual framework, the starting point of which is the weakening 
authority of 
the Sultan over both polity and economy 
in 
the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The sultanic loss of control is 
seen in phenomena ranging from the passage of power from the 
person of the Sultan to the harem and the eunuchs of the imperial 
household, to frequent urban rebellions in the centre and some 
provinces, to rampant banditry 
in the countryside, to treasury 
deficits, to price 
inflation and currency deflation, to the over-
exploitation and flight of the peasantry, to the loss of the military 
identity of the once exemplary Janissary corps, to the empire’s 
shrinking borders. Mirroring these phenomena was moral decay in 
the bureaucracy and other state institutions, where rules of fair play 
were suspended 
in 
favour of bribery, venality, corruption and 
favouritism. And, despite the reforming efforts by the Köprülü 

5 

"
16,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

viziers in the seventeenth century, and by Sultan Ahmed III in the 
early eighteenth century, the Sultan’s increasing loss of control is 
evinced in the eighteenth century by the rise of provincial notables 
acyān/ayan who asserted their regional power, challenging the grip 
of the imperial centre, Istanbul. The system needed an overhaul, 
which came with the reforming, institutionalizing and centralizing 
effort of the Tanzimat, which, in turn, gave the Ottoman empire its 
last breath before its collapse in the First World War. 
For our purposes, it is important to stress that the concept of 
the rise and decline of empires is frequently associated with the 
civilizational 
paradigm. 
The 
latter 
assumes 
that 
societal 
complexity is gauged by the aesthetic and originality value of 
cultural products. Often, when decline or stasis 
is assumed, 
cultural production is also neglected on the basis of absence of 
value. This 
treatment of 
cultural production 
thus 
reserves 
historicity only to cultural products that are deemed beautiful or 
original. I shall return to this point later in this chapter. 

Dismantling decline 

In their collective effort to tackle the assumptions of the decline 
thesis, modern 
scholars had 
to demonstrate 
the 
following 
(whether individually or severally):  

2. 

1. the changing nature and adaptability of Ottoman state and 
society;  
indigenous or internal social, economic, and/or intellectual 
processes displaying signs of modernity prior to the advent of 
the West;  
3. the comparability of Ottoman state and society with their 
counterparts in the world in the same period; and  
4. a logic, or a framework, alternative to decline and the Euro-
centricism 
implied 
therein, 
that 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
phenomena of the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries.  

Early calls 
While the anti-decline scholarship of the 1980s and 1990s was 

6 

"
17,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

explicitly or implicitly given theoretical fuel by the publication of 
Edward Said’s Orientalism,5 scepticism of the decline thesis had 
begun a quarter of a century earlier. These early ventures deserve 
more than a brief treatment, not only as antecedents to anti-
decline scholarship, but also because they were departure points 
for much of the research to come. 
The first hints of displeasure with the decline thesis were raised 
on empirical grounds. In a masterful and elegantly written essay 
published in 1957, ‘The changing face of the Fertile Crescent in 
the XVIII century’, Albert Hourani proposed 
to 
look at 
the 
eighteenth century anew ‘to ask whether in fact it was decaying 
and lifeless; whether indeed we can speak of a self-contained 
Ottoman Moslem society ‘before the full impact of the West was 
felt’.’6 This was probably one of the earliest (if not the earliest) 
exposition of the dynamics of change in the eighteenth century, 
and contained in its pages the seeds not only of Hourani’s later 
works, but of a whole generation of Ottomanists. The critical 
apertures opened in that seminal essay eventually became, with-
out exaggeration, entire trajectories that allowed for the estab-
lishment of the great masters in the field. Hourani’s observations 
about the change in imperial centre–provincial relations in the 
eighteenth century would later be officially dubbed ‘decentraliz-
ation’ by 
the master of Ottoman studies, Halil 
İnalcık.7 The 
phenomenon of the assertion of provincial local authority and the 
emergence of semi-dynastic rule in the eighteenth century was 
similarly highlighted by Hourani, and would soon after be studied 
by Abdul-Karim Rafeq, the eventual doyen of Ottoman–Syrian 
studies.8 Hourani took up the idea of the assertion of provincial 
authority to develop the model of the ‘notables’ (acyān), which 
still serves as a productive analytical category.9 As late as 1999 
Rafeq developed Hourani’s observations on the proto-nationalist 
tendencies of eighteenth-century Damascene culamāɔ.10 Hourani’s 
essay also drew attention to renewed Mediterranean trade in the 
eighteenth century and the consequent rise of certain trading 
minority communities, a subject 
that Thomas Philipp would 
develop into a fully fledged study.11 However, the significance of 

7 

"
18,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

what was perhaps one of Hourani’s subtlest observations in the 
article has only relatively recently been manifested in the scholar-
ship of the field. 

We tend to think of the Empire of Suleiman the Magnifi-
cent as the ‘true’ Empire, and judge all that came before 
and after in terms of it. Seen in this light, what came after 
was sheer decline; and in saying this, we are indeed only 
reflecting what the Ottomans themselves believed, or at least 
what they were in the habit of saying. From Khoja Bey [Koçu 
Bey] onwards, it was the custom of Ottoman writers to put 
their proposals for reform in the shape of exhortation to 
return to the great days of Sultan Suleiman.12 

Here, Hourani precociously and 
intuitively unveils the con-
structed nature of historical discourse, in this case, the myth of 
the golden age of Süleyman the Magnificent. Although stated in a 
reflective mode 
rather 
than 
as 
a methodological 
assertion, 
Hourani’s statement about the modern historian ‘reflecting what 
Ottoman [writers] themselves believed’ would encourage the next 
generation of scholars 
to exercise a healthy and productive 
scepticism towards their sources, and a vigilance not to take at 
face value what Ottomans tell us about their society for fear of 
falling into the trap of their myths. The search for the politics of, 
in and behind the text is something that Ottomanists would take 
seriously, especially when 
treating 
the genre of nasihatname 
(advice literature or ‘mirrors for princes’) to which Hourani refers 
in the passage quoted above (‘From Khoja Bey onwards, it was the 
custom of Ottoman writers to put their proposals for reform in 
the shape of exhortation to return to the great days of Sultan 
Suleiman’). The consideration of 
this reform-driven 
literature 
informed at least parts of the individual works of three important 
Ottomanists: Cornell Fleischer, Rifacat 
cAli Abou-El-Haj and 
Cemal Kafadar.13 Hourani’s 
‘The changing 
face of 
the Fertile 
Crescent’ was, and in many ways still is, to use the words of Karl 
Barbir, ‘the gateway to the field’ of Ottoman studies.14  

8 

"
19,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

But to whom was Hourani speaking in 1957? And why, in his 
proposition to re-evaluate the eighteenth century, is the sentence 
‘before the full impact of the West’ in quotation marks? And why 
is it without a reference? The probable target was just too famous 
for citation – H. A. R. Gibb and H. Bowen, Islamic Society and the 
West: A Study of the Impact of Western Civilization on Muslim 
Culture 
in the Near East.15 This was the canonical work that 
enshrined the decline thesis with all its implications: it assumed 
an autonomous, 
isolated, 
rigid, 
lethargic and decidedly pre-
modern eighteenth century Muslim society as it existed ‘before 
the full impact of the West’. The process of decanonizing this 
work was taken up, after Hourani’s discreet attempt, by two more 
direct ventures. 
Norman Itzkowitz did his own genealogical homework on Gibb 
and 
Bowen’s 
project, 
and 
in 
1962 
published 
his 
famous 
‘Eighteenth century Ottoman realities’.16 Itzkowitz’s concern was 
not ‘decline’ per se – despite a footnote calling for the recon-
sideration thereof17 – but the pedigree of empirical inaccuracy and 
prejudice of Gibb and Bowen’s 
Islamic Society and 
the West. 
Itzkowitz identifies the pedigree of Gibb and Bowen as descend-
ing from Albert Howe Lybyer’s The Government of the Ottoman 
Empire 
in 
the Time of Suleiman 
the Magnificent, published 
in 
1913.18 Lybyer, 
Itzkowitz demonstrates, offered his European 
readers a familiar, easily comprehensible formula based on state 
and church: ‘the ruling institution’ comprising the Sultan’s house-
hold and the executive and military branches of government, 
staffed by slaves of Christian origin; and ‘the Moslem institution’, 
which oversaw religious education and the promulgation and 
upholding of Islamic law, and was staffed by free-born Muslims. 
Itzkowitz shows that Gibb and Bowen’s adoption of Lybyer’s 
schema included their own special twist: they attribute the pur-
ported 
eighteenth-century decline 
to 
the 
entry of 
free-born 
Muslims into the ruling institution to replace slaves of Christian 
origin. Thus, the view of the authors is religion-determined: the 
Ottoman empire could only be successful 
if 
‘state’ 
is run by 
Christian slaves and 
‘church’ 
is run by Muslim clerics. Very 

9

astutely, Itzkowitz remarks that the thesis ‘has the … merit of 
being comforting to the Christian West’s deep-seated sense of 
superiority’,19 and quotes Kipling’s racist verses describing the 
‘Oriental mind’ as an explanation of the world-view that informs 
such a line of historical enquiry.20 To refute the Lybyer–Gibb–
Bowen thesis, Itzkowitz provides abundant examples of Muslim-
born men holding offices in the so-called ‘ruling institution’ and 
Christian-born officials in the 
‘Moslem institution’ at different 
periods of 
the history of 
the empire, 
thus 
invalidating 
the 
religious determinism that guides the vision of Gibb and Bowen. 
Itzkowitz further proposes tracing individual career trajectories of 
state officials as a guiding principle, rather than focusing on their 
religious origins. ‘Career trajectories’ could perhaps be considered 
a sub-school in Ottoman studies that falls at the juncture of 
intellectual 
history, 
historiography 
and 
state 
history, with 
Norman Itzkowitz at its centre. Itzkowitz’s study of the career of 
the grand vizier and litterateur, Raghip Pasha (d. 1763), is brack-
eted between two classic studies of the lives, works and careers of 
Ottoman historian-bureaucrats Naima (d. 1714) and Mustafa Âli 
(d. 
1600), 
by 
Itzkowitz’s 
teacher Thomas V. 
Lewis, 
and 
Itzkowitz’s student Cornell Fleischer, respectively.21 
If Itzkowitz decried the attitude towards the ‘Oriental mind’ in 
1962, Roger Owen, not an Ottomanist but an economic his-
torian of 
the modern Middle East, announced 
the 
‘end of 
Orientalism’ in 1976, two years before the publication of Said’s 
Orientalism, in an article that delivered the blow that knocked 
Gibb and Bowen’s Islamic Society and the West out of the canon 
(although their assumptions and conclusion would be restated 
by Bernard Lewis, as we shall see presently).22 Owen links the 
approach of Gibb and Bowen to government and society with, 
among others, Marx and Engels’s model of ‘Oriental despotism’, 
and 
demonstrates 
the 
over-simplifying 
and 
ideologically-
determined categories of 
‘Islamic’ (as a specific and distinct 
category different from other societies) and ‘decline’ as well as 
the unsupportable assumption of the ‘isolation’ of that society. 
Over and above Hourani and Itzkowitz’s empirical correctives 

10 

"
21,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

and lines of enquiry, and Itzkowitz’s ethico-political consider-
ations, Owen 
suggests 
a new methodological 
approach 
– 
political economy or the analysis of economic processes and 
their role in shaping society.23 Political economy had already 
been in the offing, and became one of the leading frameworks of 
analysis and sub-disciplines in Ottoman studies. 
But before turning to political economy, it is worth doing a 
playback to note the study that continued to promote the decline 
thesis. When Hourani and Itzkowitz were questioning it, Bernard 
Lewis was doing exactly the opposite: he had made Ottoman 
decline the object of his study. Lewis bemoaned the fact that 
Ottoman decline had not received serious study – with 
the 
notable exception of Gibb and Bowen’s Islamic Society and the 
West.24 He then proceeded to offer a 
‘broad classification and 
enumeration of some [of] the principal factors and process which 
led to, or were part of, or were expressions of the decline of 
Ottoman government, society, and civilization’.25 The findings of 
this article would be published in a book – The Emergence of 
Modern Turkey – that would replace Gibb and Bowen, soon to be 
decanonized, 
as 
the 
locus 
classicus of 
the decline 
thesis.26 
(Interestingly, one of Lewis’s informants is none other than Koçu 
Bey, whose complaints Hourani had warned us not to take at face 
value in the above-mentioned 1958 article, and whom Rifacat 
Abou-El-Haj would later recontextualize.) 
Remarkably, though many (most?) contemporary anti-declinists 
have cited Lewis’s book to express their discontent, few scholars 
have embarked on studies that solely and primarily deal with the 
question of decline per se. A singular exception in this regard is 
Cemal Kafadar’s ‘The question of Ottoman decline’.27 While not 
expressly presented as such, Kafadar’s essay can be posited as an 
anti-text to Bernard Lewis’s above-mentioned article and book. I 
shall return later to Kafadar’s essay, but in the meanwhile let us 
visit one of the early correctives to the decline thesis. 

Political economy and the transformation to capitalism 
A full programme for the application of the political economy

model to the study of the Middle East was proposed by Peter 
Gran in 1980.28 Gran had executed the model a year earlier in his 
path-breaking work 
Islamic Roots of Capitalism: Egypt, 1760–
1840.29 Rejecting 
the Napoleonic 
invasion as 
the moment of 
Egypt’s modernity, Gran posits 
the 
emergence of 
capitalist 
accumulation 
in Egypt 
in 
the second half of 
the eighteenth 
century – that is, prior to the arrival of Europe. But the title of the 
book is deceptive, for Gran moves beyond political economy to 
tackle the domain of culture. While the career and work of the 
scholar Hasan al-cAt tār (d. 1835) lie at the heart of the study, the 
author consults a remarkably large body of literary products in 
equally remarkable variety of fields and genres – from H adīth, to 
jurisprudence, to history, to literature, to philology, to science. 
The author recontextualizes towering intellectual figures, who 
had previously been seen either as atypical luminaries in a dark 
age, as in the cases of al-Jabartī (d. 1825) and al-cAttār, or as mere 
Westernizers, as in the case of al-Tahtāwī (d. 1873). Gran inserts 
these intellectual figures into a local cultural landscape, itself 
shifting and being shaped by socio-economic factors. Despite the 
excessive number of errors and 
inaccuracies 
that 
the book 
contains – something the many reviewers, albeit sympathetic to 
the enterprise, did not hesitate to point out30 – the book remains 
singular in its attempt to offer a comprehensive treatment that 
regards literary production as culture.31 For a long time after the 
book’s publication, 
the 
study of 
seventeenth 
to nineteenth 
century Middle East remained bifurcated into two separate realms 
– intellectual history belonging to Islamic studies on the one 
hand, and social and economic history belonging to Ottoman 
studies on the other. Culture fell through the fault line between 
these disciplines.  
At about the same time as Peter Gran was advocating political 
economy, others were offering a particular theory as a corrective 
within political economy: the Wallerstinian world-systems theory. 

World-systems theory and the logic of peripheralization

explanations of the Ottoman empire, Huri İslamoğlu-İnan  and 
Çağlar Keyder offered the model of integration/incorporation into 
the capitalist world economy (or world system).32 They suggest 
that prior to the penetration of European capital, the Ottoman 
social formation was defined by the Asiatic mode of production, 
where the state had control over land, surplus, production, and 
regulated both internal and external trade. The reproduction of 
this 
social 
formation was enabled 
through 
the 
state’s close 
management of commercial capital and of the feudalized areas of 
the economy, two elements potentially destabilizing to the social 
formation. However, starting in the late sixteenth century, the 
change in trade routes due to the rise of the Atlantic economy, the 
rise in demand for raw materials for the European market, the 
Europe-wide phenomenon of price 
inflation, and population 
growth in the Ottoman empire, precipitated various trends that 
undermined the Ottoman state’s political and economic control. 
Contraband trade increased in volume and contributed to the 
integration of Ottoman merchant capital into the capitalist world 
economy, while the state could no longer control prices that were 
now determined by the world market outside its borders. The 
Ottoman state’s resort to tax farming allowed for the emergence in 
the eighteenth century of commercial estates (çiftlik) 
for the 
production of cash crops for the European market.33 Thus, the 
social formation of world empire collapsed as the Ottoman empire 
was integrated into the periphery of the capitalist world system in 
the role of supplier of raw materials in exchange for finished 
products. Thus, to explain the phenomena of the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries, İslamoğlu and Keyder offer the 
logic of 
peripheralization instead of the thesis of decline.34 
While accepted in its broad contours, the logic of peripheral-
ization became yet another master narrative, the heavy handed 
application of which came to eclipse at 
least as much as 
it 
clarified. In the 1990s, several studies altered and nuanced the 
incorporation paradigm by offering local provincial perspec-
tives.  
One of 

these, Beshara Doumani’s Rediscovering Palestine, 

13 

"
24,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

achieved several objectives.35 By writing the history of mer-
chants and peasants of Nablus and its hinterland, Doumani not 
only gave agency to these hitherto silent social groups 
in a 
peripheral region of both the Ottoman empire and the world 
economy, 
but 
also 
contested 
competing Arab 
and 
Israeli 
nationalist historiographies of Palestine. 
In 
looking 
at 
the 
processes of production and circulation of four commodities 
(textiles, raw cotton, olive oil and soap) 
in 
the context of 
merchant-dominated commercial, social and cultural networks, 
Doumani exposes a number of institutions and practices that 
evince an indigenous capitalist transformation emerging prior to 
the penetration of European capital.  
He outlines a strong 
local commercialized and monetized 
economy that was initially unperturbed by European demand. 
He also demonstrates the rise of both a new capitalist urban elite 
and an 
integrated middle peasantry. The significance of the 
emergence of these groups is not only on the socio-economic 
level, but also on the socio-political level: the middle peasantry 
facilitated the forging of new (namely modern) discourses of 
citizenship in their appeals to the state to break the hegemony of 
the 
urban 
political 
elite. Thus, 
in Doumani’s 
rendition, 
modernity is not brought in wholesale by any of the events that 
had been traditionally viewed as its markers (the 1831 Egyptian 
invasion of Syria; the Tanzimat reforms of 1839–56, or the first 
European Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882). Rather, the 
already transformed social and economic situation in Palestine 
facilitated 
integration 
into 
the world capitalist market and 
justified 
the 
centralizing 
effort of 
the Tanzimat. Doumani 
departs from a reductively economistic approach and further 
complicates the integration into the world economy narrative by 
taking into account culture, specifically the manner in which 
family, 
religion 
and 
ritual 
facilitated 
the 
production 
and 
perpetuation 
of 
socio-economic 
relations. Thus, Doumani 
introduces culture not merely as a super-structure, but as an 
important constitutive element in its own right.

Economic history and the logic of the ‘general crisis of the seventeenth 
century’ 
Prior to the Wallerstinian turn, economic history as propounded by 
the Annales School was championed most prominently by Ömer 
Lütfi Barkan.36 Seminal studies of the demographic, economic and 
political crises of the seventeenth century were published by 
Barkan and Halil İnalcık, among others.37 Barkan showed the 
penetration into the Ottoman empire of the price revolution that 
was taking place all over Europe as a result of the influx of new 
world silver. İnalcık further linked economic crises and currency 
devaluation to demographic changes and the diffusion of firearms. 
Due to changes in war technology, the Ottoman empire could no 
longer retain the twin institutions of sipahi (cavalry) supported by 
timar (land grants given 
to cavalry officers). As part of 
its 
reorganization strategy, the empire came to depend on armed 
mercenaries made up of vagrant peasants who, for one reason or 
another, had fled their villages. Once demobilized, they became 
discontented and wreaked havoc on 
the countryside. These 
disruptions, along with a number of rebellions led by provincial 
administrators (like Canbuladoğlu Ali Pasha in Syria) came to be 
known as the Celali rebellions. The works of Barkan and İnalcık 
laid the path for the next generation of scholars exemplified in the 
prolific career of Suraiya Faroqhi, who has worked tirelessly on 
the minutiae of the economic history of Anatolia.38 Her cogent 
construction 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
(which 
inter 
alia 
summarizes the state of the field) places the Ottoman empire 
within the wider European context of the ‘general crisis of the 
seventeenth century’ where the demands of a centralizing and 
bureaucratizing state that was 
in the business of war-making 
coincided with economic difficulties due to expansion of the 
Atlantic trade. This resulted in overwhelming economic distress, 
which, in turn, effected political upheavals.39 In the logic of the 
‘general crisis of the seventeenth century’, the Ottoman empire is 
seen as neither displaying signs of decline nor as being peripher-
alized by the external factor of European capital. Rather, these 
crises are viewed as manifestations of both internal and external 

15 

"
26,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

transformations similar to those taking place in Europe, thereby 
reinstating the Ottoman empire in its European context. 

State formation: the logic behind banditry, venality and corruption 
In her revised 1987 version of the applicability of world systems 
theory to the Ottoman world, İslamoğlu-İnan  called for new con-
ceptions of 
the Ottoman state.40 This seems 
to have been a 
‘general feeling’ in the field over the next decade, which saw the 
publication of several studies showing that the fiscal measures 
adopted in the seventeenth century and the administrative decen-
tralization of the eighteenth century did not represent loss of 
either the authority or legitimacy of Ottoman rule. Rather, they 
signified the transformation and adaptability of the Ottoman state 
in rapidly changing circumstances.41 
In 1991 Rifacat cAli Abou-El-Haj published his prescient study 
Formation of the Modern State: The Ottoman Empire, Sixteenth to 
Eighteenth Centuries.42 Abou-El-Haj looked at the state’s experimen-
tation with revenue collection practices over time, and noted a 
tendency towards privatization of landholding, which, in turn, 
resulted in a change in social formation. The early modern state 
formation in the sixteenth century was a centralized system that 
was at once ‘feudal, military and hereditary’ and in which the 
ruling elite espoused merit in matters of public service just as 
long as that service remained the exclusive domain of that self-
same elite.43 The transformation brought about by the privatiz-
ation of 
land, 
the monetization of 
the economy and various 
external factors precipitated the breakdown of the old order, as 
manifested in the crises of the seventeenth century, and resulted 
in the rise of new classes and a concomitant change in the consti-
tution of the ruling elite. At the same time, the changes brought a 
decentralization of state power that found form in the emergence 
of ruling households headed by a ‘grandee’ (or acyān/ayan) whose 
politics was characterized by a utilitarian attitude to public office 
that entailed the purchase and sale of office, as well as nepotism. 
Thus, rather than taking such 
‘corruption’ as symptomatic of 
decline – as previous historians had done – Abou-El-Haj regarded 

16 

"
27,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

it as a sign of a changed order and value system. In this regard, 
Abou-El-Haj draws instructive comparisons with similar practices 
in 
eighteenth 
and nineteenth 
century England. Particularly 
original in Abou-El-Haj’s book is his use of literary sources as a 
reflection – or more accurately a deflection – of the social and 
political transformations between the sixteenth and eighteenth 
centuries. In his reading of the historical literature of nasihatname, 
he seems to take Hourani’s above-mentioned warning about the 
treacherous nature of the sources to its logical conclusion. Abou-
El-Haj sees the reform proposals in these ‘mirrors for princes’ as 
reflecting the social position and ideology of each of their authors: 
the historian Koçu Bey bewailed the collapse of the social order 
and the value system it contained because he was a representative 
of that collapsing order. The new order, on the other hand, found 
an apologist and legitimizer in the work of one of its beneficiaries: 
the historian Nacima.  
Abou-El-Haj thus achieves two goals in his book. Like Doumani 
in the next decade, he is able to debunk the notion that the 
Tanzimat, the Western-style state-driven reform movement was 
the beginning of modernization in the Middle East, and demon-
strates that it was, rather, the logical culmination of processes that 
had been going on 
in previous centuries. Second, in demon-
strating the changing nature of the Ottoman state and society 
between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, Abou-El-Haj was 
able to establish the comparability between the Ottoman empire 
and its European counterparts. 
Following up on some of the themes raised by Abou-El-Haj, 
Ariel Salzmann examines malikanes (lifelong 
tax 
farms) and 
venality, not as obstacles to the evolution of the modern state but 
as a deliberate 
fiscal policy of privatization 
that allowed 
the 
transition of the Ottoman state from its ‘precocious’ early modern 
state formation 
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to 
its 
centralized manifestation in the nineteenth century.44 To maintain 
its rule and territorial 
integrity, the Ottoman empire, 
like 
its 
counterparts in Asia and Europe, had to resort to privatization to 
access cash in times of crisis. Conceding to the demands of a new 

17 

"
28,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

political elite over both 
fiscal and political 
rights, 
the state 
extended tax farms into lifelong contracts and auctioned them on 
the market to a select elite. The malikane contract had a distinctly 
entrepreneurial aspect and functioned like a firm with shares to 
which agents and financiers were attached. It thus came to be 
viewed as an 
important 
source of 
revenue 
for 
the aspiring 
investor. On the provincial level, these tax-farm contracts, though 
much smaller in scale, were important for establishing a set of 
obligations between the state and provincial contractors, which, 
in 
turn, allowed 
for a mutually confirming relationship 
that 
functioned to entrench rather than challenge Ottoman rule. For 
various reasons the malikane system faced a crisis towards the end 
of the eighteenth century, but despite several hesitant attempts at 
its abolition the system continued into the next century to be 
eventually abolished by the Tanzimat. And, it was none other 
than the beneficiaries of the malikane system who constituted the 
main supporters 
for 
the Tanzimat effort. Thus, 
tax 
farming, 
venality and accompanying administrative decentralization did 
not threaten state authority ‘so much as to rationalize it in a 
politically effective form’ and to pave the way for the centralized 
modern state.45 
Karen Barkey looked at the Ottoman state in the late sixteenth 
and early seventeenth centuries, not as a state in decline but as a 
‘wily state responding to challenges as they emerge’.46 Barkey 
developed her argument by examining current theories of state 
formation – which are limited in application to European states – 
where state making in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 
was carried out through militarization, centralization and bureau-
cratization, despite opposition from, or at the expense of, sectors 
of society such as peasants or landed gentry. In other words, state 
making in the European context occurred as a contest between 
society and state in which the latter won. Barkey demonstrates 
that the Ottoman state similarly went through the process of state 
consolidation, but took the quite different route of negotiating 
with and co-opting discontented elements and 
incorporating 
them into its fold. According to Barkey, because of the speci-

18 

"
29,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

ficities of the Ottoman system neither peasant nor elite class-
based rebellions were possible. Rather, peasants who had become 
vagrants because of the crises of the seventeenth century were 
armed by the state to satisfy the latter’s demand for mercenary 
armies. Once demobilized, however, 
these soldiers 
turned 
to 
armed banditry and became a destabilizing force that had to be 
contained through negotiation and bargaining. Thus, participants 
in the Celali revolts of the late sixteenth to early seventeenth 
century were not 
‘primitive 
rebels’, 
and did not 
seriously 
undermine the legitimacy of the Ottoman order; rather, they were 
simply disaffected bandits who wanted to partake in the Ottoman 
order. In the end, the bandits were both created and absorbed by 
the state – and the processes of both creation and absorption were 
symptomatic of Ottoman state centralization.  

The logic of dynastic reproduction 
If political economy, economic history and the history of state 
formation tackled the decline thesis to offer correctives, alter-
native frameworks and periodization schema, gender studies too 
had a role to play. In declinist constructions, one of the major 
signs of weakening Ottoman sovereignty is the wielding of power 
by royal women in the last third of the sixteenth century and 
continuing through much of the seventeenth century. This was a 
period when 
the queen mother, or 
valide 
sultan, 
enjoyed 
unprecedented influence, at least until Turhan Sultan, as regent 
for her son, appointed Köprülü Mehmed Pasha as grand vizier 
and forfeited much of her power to him. This put an end to the 
‘Sultanate of Women’. Leslie Peirce, 
in The 
Imperial Harem: 
Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, aimed to dispel 
both early modern and modern misogynist interpretations of the 
age of powerful imperial women, and to explain the phenomenon, 
in terms not of the weakness of the sultans but of an internal logic 
of dynastic reproduction.47 Peirce notes that, despite the sultan’s 
authority, from the beginning the Ottoman dynasty allowed all 
family members, irrespective of gender, to have a share in royal 
patrimony. The exercise of authority, or political maturity, was, 

19 

"
30,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

however, linked to sexuality. For men, it was effected by the 
capacity to father a child, but for women this authority came into 
being when they achieved a post-sexual status (that is they were 
either postmenopausal or had borne a son). Given 
the 
link 
between sexuality and the exercise of power, the sexual activity of 
royal members was highly controlled by the older generation. The 
logic behind the control of sexuality was to safeguard both the 
perpetuation of the dynasty and the integrity of the incumbent 
sultan’s authority. 
According to Peirce, the rise of the queen mother figure was 
an inevitable result of the Ottoman empire’s change during the 
course of the sixteenth century from a military expansionist 
power to a sedentary, administrative bureaucracy. Initially, royal 
princes participated in state power through their appointment to 
princely governorates where they would get hands-on training, a 
chance to establish their reputation in conquest and, possibly, a 
‘constituency’ of supporters. All this would be in preparation for 
accession to the throne whereby eligible princes would have to 
prove their fitness against each other, often in open combat. 
During the heyday of the princely governorate, the prince’s 
mother would leave the imperial harem to accompany her son to 
the province (thereby achieving post-sexual status) to oversee 
his household and promote his interests. As the nature of the 
empire changed from expansionist to administrative, the prince 
as conqueror ceased to be a central figure. This transformation 
eventually led to the demise of the institution of the princely 
governorate and the reaggregation of the entire royal family into 
one imperial household in Istanbul. Once in the same house-
hold, with too many competing mothers of princes present, the 
sultan’s mother naturally occupied 
the highest rung of 
the 
hierarchy.  
At the same time, the principle of succession changed to one of 
seniority, with the throne reserved for the eldest surviving male 
member of the family, who rarely happened to be one of the 
sultan’s sons. In such a system, the role of the mother as guardian 
and mentor was 
further 
strengthened. 
To 
ascertain 
the 

20 

"
31,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

unchallenged authority of the incumbent sultan, royal princes 
were now divested of 
any political 
authority by means of 
confinement 
to 
the palace and postponement of their sexual 
maturity (they would only father children upon enthronement). 
Due to their confinement, princes ceased to be able to establish 
‘constituencies’ of supporters prior to enthronement, with the 
result that several sultans would now be deposed and replaced by 
princes who were simply too young to rule. The valide sultan thus 
became not only 
the head of an entire centralized 
imperial 
household, but also the sultan’s mentor and guide, and often his 
regent. The ‘sultanate of women’ was therefore, in contrast to the 
misogynist thesis, not an obvious cause and symptom of decline, 
but was rather the vehicle that ensured the perpetuation of rule 
by the House of Osman as empire and dynasty were undergoing 
major reorientation.  

Urban social history and new empiricism 
The discovery of Ottoman provincial judicial court records and 
central state archives as historical sources had the effect not only 
of facilitating more empirically grounded research but also of 
writing 
into history hitherto under- or unrepresented 
social 
groups 
like peasants 
and 
artisans.48 
In 
this 
regard, André 
Raymond’s Artisans et commerçants au Caire au XVIIIe siècle, 
published in 1973–74, was a tour de force.49 Raymond’s nuanced 
study of a highly differentiated artisanate and merchant class, 
along with its institutions, such as guilds, and its relations with 
the 
ruling class, was a watershed 
in 
the 
field. The work’s 
integrative approach brought out 
the role of minority com-
munities in the economic and social life of the city, and situated 
the circumstances of manufacturing and trade within the urban 
physical layout. This, with Raymond’s subsequent works, would 
propel the field of Ottoman urban social history. 
Raymond’s masterful work opened the way for discontented 
scholars to subject the decline thesis to empirical testing and 
verification through the study of urban social history. One such 
study 
is Abraham Marcus’s The Middle East on 
the Eve of 

21 

"
32,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Modernity: Aleppo in the Eighteenth Century.50 Marcus asks several 
questions that challenge previous Orientalist assumptions about 
Middle Eastern cities. Had Aleppo been in a condition of stasis 
before 
the nineteenth century? Was Islam 
the sole and only 
referent in understanding the social and cultural history of the 
city? And had Aleppo conformed to the stereotype of the ‘Islamic 
city’ 
inhabited by a 
‘mosaic’ of 
isolated confessional and/or 
neighbourhood communities.  
Marcus takes an intimate and sweeping look at Aleppo; he 
examines its economics, politics and governance, as well as its 
social and cultural life (including popular and learned culture and 
the attitude to and treatment of health, disease and death). He 
also offers a characterization of the urban experience ranging 
from neighbourhood life to public services, personal privacy and 
the public spirit. Although the author detects both long-term and 
‘cyclical’ changes in Aleppo in the eighteenth century, he does not 
see the radical change usually associated with modernity (though 
one must warn that the temporal span of Marcus’s sources is 
limited to only three decades, hence generalizations about the 
eighteenth century as such may be inapplicable). While Marcus 
does see community-based social organization, whether according 
to neighbourhood or faith, he notes that class differentiation cuts 
across 
these 
groupings, 
allowing 
for 
city-wide 
action 
that 
transcends local community.  
Perhaps one of Marcus’s most important contributions is the 
demonstration of the extent to which there existed a variance 
between the ideal of Islamic law as found in legal texts and its 
daily application at the judicial court. The divergence between the 
legal 
text and 
the practice of 
the 
law shows 
that previous 
conceptualizations of the Middle East that focused mainly on the 
morphology of the city and explained it in terms of Islamic law 
are both inaccurate and insufficient for an understanding of the 
urban experience and the functioning of the city. In short, a 
determinedly philological understanding of Islamic society that 
assumes 
an 
essential uniqueness 
embodied 
in 
the 
text 
is 
demonstrably fallacious. To comprehend how the city operated 

22

33,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

and how its citizens experienced it, we need not only new con-
ceptualizations of the city that go beyond morphology and the 
Islamic ideal but also new empirically-grounded research such as 
that of Raymond and Marcus.51 

Intellectual history: renewal, reform, enlightenment? 
In her survey of scholarship on the eighteenth century, Jane 
Hathaway described 
intellectual history as 
the 
‘big 
lacuna’.52 
Though there is still much work to be done on Ottoman intel-
lectual history, the problem has less to do with the dearth of work 
than with the work being done under a different rubric: Islamic 
studies. There, too, the general thrust has been towards anti-
decline, but is concerned with Islamic decline at large and not 
specifically with Ottoman decline. Intellectual historians of the 
period have been following reformist trends, as well as the careers 
and 
ideas of 
individual 
intellectuals within the wider Islamic 
world.53 
For two decades now attention has been paid to eighteenth-
century 
intellectual 
reformulations 
and/or 
reformist 
thought. 
Fazlur Rahman noted a change in the attitude to and practice of 
Sufism, which he famously dubbed ‘neo-Sufism … Sufism reformed 
on orthodox lines’ (that is sharīcah-minded); it focused on the 
thus concerned with Hadīth 
person of 
the Prophet (and was 
studies) and was ‘activist’.54 Taking this phenomenon as a point of 
departure, John Voll led a trend in the field that sought to identify 
connections between the different reformist movements in chains 
of scholarly networks that overlapped in the holy cities of Mecca 
and Medina.55 In Germany, Reinhard Schulze declared an autoch-
tone 
Islamische Aufklärung (an autochthonous 
Islamic Enlight-
enment) and thereby sparked a controversy that lasted for more 
than 
a decade.56 He 
located 
an 
indigenous 
subjective 
self-
consciousness and rationalism in the mystical beliefs and activities 
of the eighteenth century, which, in turn, provided fertile ground 
for 
the 
emergence of 
an 
anthropocentric world-view 
and 
a 
concomitant liberation of the urban bourgeoisie from state control. 
Critics, most virulently Bernd Radtke, have objected to many of 

23 

"
34,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Schulze’s proposals, not least the use of concepts and terminology 
seen as the preserve of Western history.57 While many disagree 
with Schulze’s propositions, whether in toto or in detail, Stefan 
Reichmuth noted that, 
‘whenever Schulze’s critics, after having 
done with “Islamic Enlightenment”, set out to develop their own 
ideas about Islamic cultural and intellectual development in the 
eighteenth century, they can be seen as keeping remarkably close to 
Schulze’s own concepts.’58 Whatever its intrinsic merits, the Islamic 
Enlightenment debate has pushed the field towards a return to a 
reconstituted (post-Orientalist) intellectual history and an interest 
from Hadīth and 
in 
the early modern period.59 Moving away 
Sufism, reformists and reform, Khaled El-Rouayheb has focused on 
the study of philosophy in the early modern Arab Middle East, 
which had been presumed to have abated in Sunni Islam since the 
medieval great masters. El-Rouayheb has patiently registered the 
resurgence in the study of logic, noting movements of texts and 
scholars between North Africa, Egypt, the Levant and Iran, while at 
the same time extending the temporal span back into the seven-
teenth century.60 
But, what is Ottoman about the foregoing? The answer is every-
thing and nothing. While many of the activities historians have 
charted 
have 
taken 
place within Ottoman 
domains, 
as 
I 
mentioned at the outset the thrust of contemporary scholarship in 
intellectual history has not sought to link these intellectual trends 
to those occurring at the imperial centre, probably because most 
modern scholars are proficient in either Arabic or Ottoman but 
rarely in both.61 Furthermore, as is the habit of intellectual history 
in which state and power are treated as accidents rather than as 
part and parcel of the analysis, very few studies have 
linked 
intellectual currents to the politics and/or socio-economics of (in 
our case the Ottoman) empire.62 Thus, things Ottoman seem to be 
at the margins of intellectual history. As such, discussions about 
reform, renewal and/or enlightenment in the eighteenth century 
have not seriously been linked to the different frameworks offered 
in lieu of Ottoman decline in the foregoing sections. Similarly, the 
work that has been undertaken on 
intellectual history at the 

24 

"
35,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

imperial centre has not been linked to the wider context of the 
Islamic world.  
While not concerned with Ottoman decline or 
intellectual 
history per se, Madeline Zilfi’s study of 
the official 
learned/ 
religious institution (ilmiye) in Istanbul in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries is of relevance.63 Although the character-
ization of the evolution of the institution and its attendant social 
history is her main concern, a significant part of Zilfi’s project is 
devoted to the rise and fall of the Kadızadeli movement in the 
seventeenth century. The movement had its roots in the writings 
of Birgivi Mehmed (d. 1573) and may have 
influenced 
later 
reform movements, both in terms of ideology and praxis. While 
Zilfi does not dwell on the intellectual and ideological import of 
the movement, she 
is able 
to 
locate Kadızadeli activism and 
popular support within a social context in which the ilmiye was 
simultaneously 
facing 
institutional 
instability. The connection 
between 
the Kadızadeli and eighteenth-century reform move-
ments still awaits serious exploration. 
Like Zilfi, Cornell Fleischer was unconcerned about decline as 
such when he wrote about the life and career of historian, bureau-
crat and poet Mustafa Âli (d. 1600).64 However, among other 
things like changes in the Ottoman bureaucracy and the place of 
non-religious law (kanun) in its workings, the study brings out a 
crucial aspect in Ottoman historiography – what became dubbed 
as ‘decline consciousness’. Mustafa Âli’s career frustrations led 
him to write a reformist critique of the Ottoman system that 
ushered onto 
the scene of historiography a whole genre of 
Ottoman ‘mirrors for princes’ (nasihatname) of which the central 
theme was Ottoman decline. In unveiling the personal motivation 
behind historiography, Fleischer’s study opened 
the way 
for 
modern historians to treat the decline historiography produced by 
Ottomans with scepticism. Consequently, the ‘decline conscious-
ness’ found in Ottoman texts was not immediately to be translated 
into real Ottoman decline. Differentiating between the textual and 
the real is something that Hourani advised in the late 1950s and 
that Abou-El-Haj executed in the early 1990s. 

25

Between the perceived and the real: decline and renewal? 
Earlier I mentioned Cemal Kafadar’s ‘The question of Ottoman 
decline’ and posited it as an anti-text to Bernard Lewis’s Emergence 
of Modern Turkey. But Kafadar’s essay, published in 1998, was also 
a response to almost two decades of anti-decline scholarship.  
On the one hand, Kafadar finds the category of decline woefully 
imprecise in that it inaccurately lumps together changes in ‘all 
spheres of life – political, military, institutional, social, economic 
and cultural’ – to cast them negatively in a linear and totalizing 
manner.65 Taking declinists on their own terms without resorting 
to alternative frameworks, Kafadar offers a quick narrative of the 
Ottoman empire in which he looks at government apparatuses 
and 
institutions, the economy, the military and technological 
change. Although remarkably similar to Lewis in his choice of 
subjects, Kafadar arrives at a different conclusion in which he 
shows that decline as an overarching category lacks historicity 
and explanatory function.  
On the other hand, Kafadar is dissatisfied with the political 
correctness 
that has come with 
the baggage of anti-decline 
scholarship (‘one might even fear that “decline” is turning into 
“the d-word”, shunned because it seems to be the incorrect thing 
to say’).66 One of his major concerns is precisely the above-out-
lined separation carried out by modern scholars between the 
textual and the real in decline-consciousness literature. Kafadar 
does not want to dismiss the complaints and diagnostics of the 
nasihatname 
literature as mere 
inaccurate perceptions. Simul-
taneously, he wants to show that the reform literature did not 
idealize Sultan Süleyman’s rule as a ‘golden age’ and thus did not 
suffer 
from 
the 
‘traditionalism’ purported 
in modern scholar-
ship.67 In attempting to save the nasihatname authors, Kafadar 
shows 
a 
certain 
congruence between Ottoman 
realities 
and 
textual claims by demonstrating (some would say conceding) a 
very relative and limited decline in terms of the empire’s ‘delivery 
of force and the ability to command obedience and awe’ starting 
in the seventeenth century (a crude feminist interpretation would 
be 
that 
if one wants 
to 
look at history 
from a militaristic, 

26 

"
37,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

testosterone-driven angle, then yes, 
there was decline).68 Yet, 
Kafadar’s conclusion is not one that confirms Ottoman decline, 
but rather sees that every ‘warp of decline’ was entangled in the 
‘weft of renewal’. 
So, is the decline/anti-decline dialectic now resolved? I would 
suggest a hesitant positive answer (the anxiety surrounding the 
answer is explained in the Epilogue to this chapter). If, according 
to Amy Singer (in the opening quotation), it would have been 
intellectually lazy to espouse the decline thesis in 1999, then, 
given the state of the field today, it is equally lazy to espouse anti-
decline 
in 
2007. The 
invocation 
of 
decline 
is 
not 
only 
academically superfluous but it also undermines the achievements 
of scholarship in the past 25 years, which are many. Regardless of 
what one may 
think of an 
individual revisionist work, or a 
particular method or framework, the cumulative effect of the 
scholarship has demonstrated 
the 
empirical 
and 
theoretical 
invalidity of the decline thesis, and offered a portrayal of an 
internally dynamic Ottoman 
state 
and 
society. 
It has 
also 
established the comparability of the Ottoman empire to other – 
mainly European – societies and polities, and concomitantly 
revised the existing scheme of periodization. A Middle Eastern 
modernity marked by the Napoleonic moment or the Tanzimat 
effort 
is now 
a questionable 
equation, 
and 
‘Ottoman 
early 
modernity’, not a ‘post-classical age’, has become tenable.69 In 
addition 
to developing new and creative methods of writing 
Ottoman history, anti-decline scholarship has also demonstrated 
the importance of healthy scepticism towards the sources. 

Ottoman cultural history/studies: textual tribulations 

Kafadar’s above-mentioned essay reinforces our observation on 
the conspicuous absence of culture 
from 
the 
list of books 
mentioned by Amy Singer in the opening excerpt: ‘Among the 
least studied aspects of Ottoman history, despite some recent 
stirrings, is cultural life.’70 
But, ever since, the field has witnessed what one may term a 
‘cultural turn’ both 
in terms of 
interest 
in cultural 
life and 

27 

"
38,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

products, and in the utilization of cultural analysis. Some early 
‘stirrings’ include the appearance in English in 2000 of Suraiya 
Faroqhi’s Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the 
Ottoman Empire.71 In the same year, a volume on consumption 
history edited by Donald Quataert was published and, though it 
focused primarily on 
the 
social 
and 
economic 
aspects of 
consumption, it also evinced interest in material culture.72 Over 
the past five to six years, the field has accumulated many studies 
on various aspects of culture, which include, just to name a few, 
body and disability, public gardens, homoeroticism, popular 
protest and coffee house culture.73  
Given this particular history of contemporary Ottoman his-
toriography, which witnessed the cultural turn only after a long 
wave of anti-decline scholarship in which cultural history was 
scant, two questions come to mind: First, is there a relationship 
between the fall of the decline thesis and the rise of cultural 
history/studies? Second, how has Ottoman cultural history dealt 
with the legacy of anti-decline scholarship?  
Regarding what one may call the inverse relationship between 
cultural history and anti-decline scholarship one may conjec-
turally offer two possible reasons that might have precipitated this 
relationship, both of which involve (but of course are not limited 
to) fear of the text. The first has to do with the possibility of 
empirical research and the availability of sources for it on the one 
hand, and 
the decline 
thesis on 
the other. For a 
long 
time 
empirical research was obviated by the fact that the text, which 
delivered evidence that was anecdotal at best and unreliable at 
worst, provided the main source for history. The discovery of 
court records and other official documents was received with 
relief and excitement, for these sources delivered vast pools of 
data (which 
inter alia could be subjected to quantitative and 
statistical analysis) and allowed Ottoman history to move from 
narrative and institutional history to scientifically ‘solid’ studies 
and, in due course, to debunk the decline thesis. Interestingly, 
these records and documents lent themselves to social, economic 
and state history, while the text was mostly neglected (or given 

28 

"
39,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

the 

field of 

in 

important only 

secondary status), 
to remain 
intellectual history.  
But 
if the first reason that I offered to explain the 
inverse 
relationship between anti-decline history and cultural history has 
to do with a fear of the text because of its inherent testimonial 
weakness, the second reason is linked to another fear, an epis-
temological one. This latter fear is related less to cultural history 
per se than to the method of cultural analysis, which is derived in 
large part from textual approaches. Both Orientalist scholarship 
and the related civilizationalist narrative had enshrined the text as 
the central piece of scholarship. Orientalist scholarship not only 
depended on the text for its primarily philological methods but 
also drew its generalizations from textual ideals and idealizations. 
The civilizationist narrative, as mentioned earlier, valorized the 
text (among other cultural products) in terms of quality and 
originality, and saw 
it as an 
indication of progress or back-
wardness. Thus, the associations between essentialist methods 
and the text may have resulted in a general distaste for the latter. 
But it was not only the text that was disposed of; the associated 
possibilities of discursive methods and cultural analyses were also 
ignored. It is highly instructive that in her excellent critique of 
essentialist methods, Huri İslamoğlu-İnan characterizes them as 
‘culturalist’ in orientation and assumptions.74 Culture, in other 
words, seems to have had a bad name. 
Thus, in an attempt to establish new truths against the decline 
thesis, most anti-decline scholarship took a generally materialist 
approach based on archival research. In this approach society and 
economy take precedence over culture, which more often than 
not is seen as a superstructure. Similarly, the text is demoted 
because of its factual unreliability and association with essentialist 
methods. The urgency of the mission of anti-decline scholarship 
may have resulted in an impatience for the ambiguities of cultural 
analysis.  
To return to the second question posed above, how has the 
emerging 
field of Ottoman 
cultural history dealt with 
the 
scholarship of the 1980s and 1990s? To answer this question I 

29 

"
40,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

return to recent treatments of literary production, reading and 
book history (not taking into account print culture, which in the 
case of the Middle East only became entrenched in the nineteenth 
century). 

The cultural dimension of textual production: early modern order-
preserving anxiety or modern subversive radicalism 
In his comment on the nasihatname literature, Kafadar charac-
terizes this decline-conscious literature as ‘part of a condition the 
Ottomans 
shared with 
their 
early modern European 
con-
temporaries: anxiety’.75 He further advised extending this rubric 
(of early modern anxiety) to include other literary production of 
the period including popular literature, which he saw as equally 
decline conscious as its elite counterpart, the nasihatname. By 
placing cultural phenomena in the Ottoman empire in the context 
of general ‘early modernity’, Kafadar rejects limits that may hinder 
comparative analysis, either geographically (Europe versus the 
Middle East) or civilizationally (the West versus the Islamic/ 
Ottoman world). As for broadening the analysis to include literary 
production beyond the ‘mirrors for princes’ literature, Kafadar 
had executed his own idea a decade earlier (in 1989) when he 
traced the emergence of 
‘first person narratives’ 
in the social 
dislocation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.76 In this 
study, Kafadar also brought out the cultural specificity (namely 
the Ottoman variation) of early modernity by exploring Sufi 
(mystical) practices surrounding textual production. In the con-
text of great social dislocation, individuals and groups found in 
mystical social and literary practices some anchorage in the sea of 
change. The literary result was the first-person narrative, which 
expressed anxieties about a changing order.  
More than a decade later Kafadar’s student, Derin Terzioğlu, 
took both the logic of ‘early modern anxiety’ and the Sufi con-
nection to produce an excellent analysis of the diary of the mystic 
Nıyazı Mısri  (d. 1694).77 While more concerned with the literary 
hybrid nature of popular texts, my own work on a barber his-
torian in eighteenth-century Damascus also frames the analysis in 

30 

"
41,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

terms of anxiety, disorder and dislocation.78 Away from anxiety, 
but still within the frame of early modernity, Astrid Meier has 
identified a 
tendency 
to represent 
the characteristically early 
modern sentiments of melancholy and solitude in the historical 
writings of the culamāɔ in Damascus.79 
Nelly Hanna, who provided a much needed and overdue 
monographic 
treatment 
on 
book 
history, 
took 
a 
different 
approach from the one outlined above. In her In Praise of Books 
(2003) she explores the existence in Cairo in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries of a sophisticated book culture outside the 
traditional domains of 
the courtly and religious, or 
learned, 
classes.80 This book culture, according to Hanna, reflects concern 
for the secular and quotidian, and reveals a line of enquiry moti-
vated by observation and empiricism. The certain 
tenor 
that 
Hanna attributes to the content of this culture is further assured 
by her explanations for its rise – the emergence of a literate, 
modern middle class that came about as a result of a prosperous 
Mediterranean 
trade. Thus, Hanna, 
like Kafadar, sees 
textual 
production as a reflection of larger transformations; she, however, 
portrays a more certain, even comfortable and convivial outcome. 
In her Cairo, the participants in the market of new texts are not 
anxiety-ridden subjective voices attempting to preserve the social 
order, but a confident group of progressive radical intellectuals.  
This is no place to attempt to resolve whether new textual pro-
duction 
in 
the Ottoman empire during 
the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries characterized early modern order-preserving 
anxiety à la Kafadar (and those who see early modern sentiments 
in the textual productions of the period), or modern subversive 
radicalism à la Hanna. Indeed, these two phenomena may not 
even be related and each may be specific to its particular geo-
graphical 
location 
(Egypt 
and 
the 
central Ottoman 
lands 
respectively). 
In short, 
these phenomena are not necessarily 
mutually exclusive. This is also not the place to quibble over 
methods of 
evaluating Hanna’s materialist 
approach 
against 
Kafadar’s inclination towards cultural analysis. What is important, 
however, 
is 
the 
identification of 
the phenomenon of 
textual 

31 

"
42,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

production and the simultaneous recognition that literary culture 
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is worth investigat-
ing. Would these studies have been possible without the anti-
decline scholarship of the previous generation?  
On the one hand, had it been pursued earlier, cultural history 
would have helped the anti-decline effort and reinforced work in 
other sub-fields. On the other hand, it is exactly the work done in 
these other fields that gave the next generation the licence to 
think of Ottoman history as being comparable, coeval in terms of 
periodization, and as fitting into categories beyond Islamic terms. 
Perhaps the most important leap that anti-decline scholarship 
achieved, and that constituted an enabling 
factor 
for cultural 
history, is the gradual departure from the civilizational paradigm, 
whose treatment of cultural products I have outlined above.  
The belief in Ottoman civilizational decline seems to have hin-
dered the investigation of cultural artefacts on the grounds that 
they were considered valueless. However, once new frameworks 
and logics (that were alternatives to decline and hence to the 
civilizational narrative) had been offered, it became possible to 
view cultural products differently. The point of cultural history is 
not the product per se, but rather that all of the product, its uses, 
and the value its users ascribe to it, become objects of study. 
From a cultural history viewpoint, every product – regardless of 
its aesthetic or novelty value – deserves a history. Once anti-
decline scholarship had questioned the civilizational narrative it 
became possible to think culturally and to attribute historicity to 
all cultural products and not only a select few. The value of the 
text is no longer to do with aesthetics and originality; it is no 
longer merely a source from which to collect information, and its 
idealizations no longer guide our enquiry. Rather, the text is 
expressive of wider socio-economic transformations; it is indica-
tive of specific cultural phenomena and is invested with meanings 
that need 
to be decoded. We now 
think 
it 
is possible and 
necessary to look at book culture, to trace the emergence of first-
person narratives and to find melancholy and anxiety in Ottoman 
texts.  

32 

"
43,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

As it stands today, Ottoman cultural history can both contribute 
to old debates and shape new ones. Cultural history can add to 
processes begun by earlier scholarship, as well as independently 
chart completely new territories. Although cultural history has 
made a recent debut, its studies have already produced internal 
debates. This book 
includes all 
these possibilities of cultural 
history. Each study continues to undo, offers new beginnings, or 
engages with recent scholarship. 

Tulips and coffee houses 

As a springboard from which to introduce the chapters in this 
volume, I will use Ariel Salzmann’s ‘The age of tulips’, which 
appeared in 2000.81 Significantly, that study was published in the 
same collection on consumption history that I located as a bridge 
between economic and social history on 
the one hand and 
cultural history on the other. Thus, this book comes as the logical 
next step: another edited collection, but one in which the main 
preoccupation is culture.  
Taking the tulip as a transcultural sign and luxury commodity, 
Salzmann 
traces 
synchronically 
and diachronically both 
the 
symbolic and real value of this flower. She follows the course of 
the transposition of the form of the tulip across the various media 
from poetry to tiles, textiles, canvas and embroidery, and of the 
real flower (as a much demanded horticultural specimen) as it 
travelled throughout Eurasia.  
She posits the tulip as a site of competition between early 
modern court societies, the characteristic theatricality of which 
compelled the elite to burst onto the public space displaying 
pomp and pageantry and taking as the mise en scène new forms of 
built environment (new gardens and new home and palace 
architecture).82 Such an indulgence in and display of luxury is 
seen as a reflection of the ‘expanded reach of exchange networks 
and 
the changing content of commercial 
interaction between 
regions and 
states’ giving 
rise 
to a distinctly early modern 
preindustrial consumerist culture.83 It 
is a 
‘transnational’ elite 
culture that utilized shared vocabularies – in this case the tulip – 

33 

"
44,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

in the articulation of power and privilege within and outside their 
societies.  
So what do tulips have to do with coffee houses and Ottoman 
history? The Ottoman elite was very much part of this early 
modern, 
transnational, 
consumerist 
culture 
and 
the 
fervent 
cultivation of and decoration with tulips. But Turkish nationalist 
historiography inscribed the Ottoman cult of tulips with multiple 
significations and packaged it in a neat civilizational narrative. 
The cult of tulips became emblematic of the first three decades of 
the Ottoman eighteenth century, dubbed Lale Devri (the Tulip 
Period), when Sultan Ahmed III (who ruled from 1703 to 1730) 
and his grand vizier Nevşehirli İbrahim Pasha (who held office 
from 1718 to 1730) undertook a series of reforms, including the 
establishment of 
the 
first Ottoman printing press set up by 
Ibrahim Müteferrika. This period is remembered not only for its 
reforms and tulip mania, but also 
‘theatrically’ in its imperial 
circumcision festival and architecturally in the building of the 
Saadabad 
(‘Abode of Happiness’) palace. 
In 1730 a popular 
rebellion led by Patrona Halil, a coffee shop owner, ended with 
the abdication of the sultan and the destruction of the palace of 
Saadabad. Turkish nationalist historiography had posited 
this 
sequence of events as a story of 
‘precocious modernization’ 
undertaken by an enlightened ruler that came to a tragic end with 
a rebellion initiated by the sultan’s reactionary and benighted 
Muslim subjects.84 In other words, historians had constructed the 
‘tulip period’ as an attempt at a Western-inspired rise that met the 
fate of inevitable Muslim decline. Salzmann rewrites the narrative 
by exposing the underlying social conflict behind the rebellion. 
Rather than the preservation of religious and cultural identity or 
the fear of modernizing change, it was the harsh material realities 
and social conditions that instigated Patrona Halil and his artisan 
compatriots to launch their revolt. Significantly, the revolt was 
launched from a coffee house. Thus, if the target of the rebellion 
was the palace, both physically and symbolically, the coffee house 
had come to mean the anti-palace. 
Tulips and coffee (as cultural products) and related institutions 

34 

"
45,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

(like the palace, coffee house and so-called ‘Tulip Period’) have 
come to bear multiple meanings in both the history and historiog-
raphy of 
the Ottoman empire. 
It 
is with 
aspects of 
these 
significations that the present volume is concerned.  
In Chapter 2, Can Erimtan proposes a similar project to that of 
Salzmann’s, but the cultural product here is the famed palace of 
Saadabad, the construction and eventual destruction of which in 
the aftermath of the Patrona Halil rebellion represents another of 
those emblems of the ‘Tulip Period’. Supposedly as part of his 
Westernizing imperial project, Sultan Ahmed III commissioned 
the building of the palace as a replica of Versailles, or so the 
received wisdom has it. Erimtan takes a genealogical approach to 
the historiography of the narrative of the ‘tulip period’ and the 
building of Saadabad and reveals its ‘manufacture’ at the hands of 
the early twentieth-century Ottoman historian Ahmed Refik who, 
the author argues, was following his own political agenda of 
justifying the reform project underway in his own time. Having 
uncovered the politics and mechanics behind the narrative of the 
‘tulip period’, Erimtan proceeds to offer an alternative narrative 
that sees Saadabad in the context of Ottoman–Safavid rivalry. He 
demonstrates that the Ottoman palace makes direct architectural 
references to Safavid architecture, especially the palace of Chihil 
Sutun. Thus, instead of a Westernization project, the commission-
ing of Saadabad and its architectonic features is placed in the 
context of a shared 
inter-Islamic competitive vocabulary and 
within a new Islamicate geography.  
Yet another symbol of the ‘Tulip Period’ is the reputedly failed 
project of 
the 
first Ottoman printing press, 
that of 
Ibrahim 
Müteferrika. Like the destruction of Saadabad in the ‘tulip period’ 
narrative, the purported failure of the first Ottoman printing press 
has been posited as reflective of the general ill-preparedness of the 
Ottoman public 
for enlightened reform. 
In Chapter 3, Orlin 
Sabev, like Erimtan, takes a genealogical approach to the histori-
ography of the first Ottoman printing press to demonstrate that 
the 
sources of 
the 
alleged 
failure of Müteferrika’s printing 
enterprise are rather unreliable. Having unearthed the probate 

35 

"
46,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

inventory prepared after Ibrahim Müteferrika’s death, Sabev is 
able to offer a statistical analysis showing the production and sale 
of the Müteferrika printed books. He concludes that Müteferrika 
had managed to sell 70 per cent of the books produced in his 
print shop, a figure that cannot be considered a failure by any 
measure. 
Indeed, 
in comparison with 
the earliest European 
printing 
ventures, 
the 
first Ottoman printing press was 
a 
resounding success. So, like Salzmann before them, Sabev and 
Erimtan make further inroads into shaking the foundations of the 
‘tulip period.’  
In Chapter 4, Babak Rahimi 
treats 
the 
theatricality of 
the 
pageantry of imperial ritual. He traces changes in symbolism and 
participation in Ottoman imperial public circumcision celebra-
tions between 1582 and 1720. He observes changes in the course 
of the ritual procession, the composition of its participants and 
the shape and make up of the procession marker – the fertility 
symbol of the nahil (wooden poles displayed in the public and 
court 
festivals associated with 
the circumcision of a prince). 
Grounding his study in the theories of Mary Douglas, works on 
the early modern ‘theatre state’, and Rifacat Abou-El-Haj’s above-
mentioned monograph, Rahimi sees the change in significations 
of the eighteenth century imperial ritual as reflective of ‘changes 
in state and collective 
identity 
formation processes … where 
power was both enacted and represented to affirm state authority 
and social solidarity’. Rahimi ends his chapter by comparing 
Ottoman circumcision celebrations with contemporary Safavid 
Muharram rituals.  
Moving away from the palace to the ‘anti-palace’, in Chapter 5 
Ali Çaksu 
takes 
the reader 
to 
the 
Janissary coffee shops of 
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Istanbul. Beyond serving as a 
rebel headquarters, the Janissary coffee shop, Çaksu shows us, 
performed a multiplicity of functions. Based on extensive original 
research in Ottoman chronicles and archives, the author paints an 
unprecedently vivid image of the Janissary coffee house, seeing it 
as a ‘place to drink coffee and smoke tobacco, but … also a cul-
tural salon, rebel headquarters, police precinct, Sufi lodge, business 

36 

"
47,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

office, and mafia club all rolled into one’. Given that the coffee shop 
served such a variety of functions over and above coffee sipping, 
the Ottoman coffee shop demands new theoretical consideration. 
This is exactly what Alan Mikhail will do in the next chapter.  
Recent conceptualizations have posited 
the Ottoman coffee 
house as home to subversive political activity and as a public 
institution defined by male sociability. In Chapter 6, pushing 
theoretical limits, Mikhail eschews Jürgen Habermas’s dichoto-
mous category of 
‘public’ and 
‘private’ 
for Michel Foucault’s 
‘heterotopia’. The author looks at the social, legal, architectural 
and literary dimensions of Ottoman coffee houses in the cities of 
Istanbul, 
Cairo 
and 
Aleppo 
and 
provides 
a 
counter-
characterization for every recent depiction of the coffee shop. 
What emerges is a complex image of the neighbourhood coffee 
house as possessing overlapping (often seemingly contradictory) 
functions and multiple identities.  
Thus, between the tulip and the coffee house, as a collective 
enterprise the contributors to this book visit elite and popular, 
state and society (and the spaces in-between) to examine aspects 
of Ottoman culture as they consider ritual, architecture, tech-
nology and sociability. 
The authors continue to undo previous nationalist construc-
tions 
that 
saw 
the early eighteenth century as a period of 
Western-inspired arrested change. Instead, they assume the com-
mensurability of Ottoman culture by using categories applicable 
to other societies and cultures while underlining inter-Islamicate 
inspirations and 
interactions. At the same time, some of the 
studies offer new theoretical propositions and fresh data that may 
open up possibilities and problematics to induce further research. 
In the final analysis, the studies herein take change as a given, 
thanks to the enabling efforts of previous generations.  

Epilogue: decline dismantled?  
The political predicament and the defensive posture 

In the foregoing I declare the end of decline and anti-decline 
scholarship, but a mitigating note is in order. Although there is 

37 

"
48,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

undeniable consensus in the field that the decline thesis has been 
entirely debunked, a revised image of the Ottoman empire in the 
post-sixteenth century has not yet infiltrated other fields and has 
not yet been accepted in the world outside the academy. Thus, 
despite 
the effort of 
the past 25 years and 
the readiness of 
Ottomanists to participate in public history, the decline thesis 
persists.85 What is the problem?  
One can think of a host of reasons for the recalcitrance of the 
decline thesis, including intellectual and institutional ones, but 
here I shall briefly touch on the most obvious – the political 
predicament. It seems that we are caught in an epistemological 
hegemony that lies beyond our immediate academic field and that 
resides in global power relations, thus forcing us to remain in a 
defensive position.  
While we have been and still are in the process of liberating the 
history of the Middle East from both imperialist and nationalist 
constructions, the Middle East has not yet been liberated from 
imperialism and, in turn, from defensive nationalisms. Nationalist 
sentiments in the Middle East aside (which have been current 
since the late nineteenth century but which may even go back to 
the eighteenth century), the very marking of the nation-state 
happened with the colonial pen in the aftermath of the First 
World War. Colonial and post-colonial imperial interests in the 
Middle East have not subsided since then and are bolstered and 
justified by a civilizing discourse. The most recent manifestation 
of both imperial interests and the concomitant discourse are the 
war on, and occupation of, 
Iraq, 
the continuing assault on 
Palestinian territories, and the brutal most recent 
invasion of 
Lebanon. All of this for the purpose of (yet another) drawing of a 
new Middle East.86 Behind this is a rhetoric of democratization, 
creation of civil society and, in the case of Lebanon, a return to its 
old glory. This is not only remarkably reminiscent of declinist 
discourse, but it is also an actual extension of it: the Middle East, 
fraught with 
fanatic 
fundamentalism and 
tyranny, can only 
achieve 
secular 
democracy 
through 
pre-emptive wars 
and 
invasions by the ‘civilized’ world (namely the West). And as long 

38 

"
49,"DECLINE, ITS DISCONTENTS AND OTTOMAN CULTURAL HISTORY 

as the powers that be demand the discourse of decline, supply is 
readily found, whether in the figure of the Middle East expert in 
the media or in popular histories and documentaries.  
In the Middle East the decline thesis was upheld for a long time 
by Middle Eastern historians themselves, having partly internal-
ized 
the Orientalist discourse 
and partly 
in 
service of 
the 
nationalist 
agendas 
of 
their 
fledgling 
nation-states. 
In 
an 
atmosphere of national liberation and decolonization, the nation-
state seemed to be the inevitable and desirable end. In the name 
of ethnic-nationalist ideologies, a history of decline was written to 
justify these exclusivist states.87 However, while historians have 
turned away (and continue to do so) from the nationalist historio-
graphical project,88 defensive regimes 
in the Middle East still 
require it as part of their legitimation routine. As such, school 
curricula continue to teach it and most national celebrations are 
annual reminders 
that 
imply 
former decline. This nationalist 
legitimation routine has been enhanced by and has become doubly 
necessary because of the continuing imperialist gaze and military 
menace.  
A related issue that is not limited to the history of the Middle 
East but affects the rest of the non-Western world, and that I 
mentioned above when discussing the category of decline, 
is 
Eurocentrism. While the thrust of anti-decline scholarship has 
been to counter European hegemonic narratives, it sometimes 
inadvertently confirmed a position of European centrality. Anti-
decline scholarship rightly understood that the yardstick of Otto-
man decline was an assumption of European ascendancy. The 
negation of Ottoman decline and the emphasis on indigenous 
processes have, however, failed to disinvest us of the exemplary 
status attributed to Europe. What is implied in some anti-decline 
work is ‘like Europe, the Middle East also’, or ‘this happened in 
the Middle East even before it did in Europe.’ One’s objection to 
this stems neither from jealousy of European specificity nor from 
a belief that it is impossible to draw comparisons between the 
Middle East and Europe (quite the contrary!), but is a criticism of 
our 
incapacity 
truly to 
transcend Eurocentricity. Thus, at an 

39 

"
50,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

epistemological 
level, the defensive nature of the anti-decline 
stance has 
indirectly perpetuated 
centre–periphery 
relations 
instead of what 
it 
sought 
to 
achieve, namely decentering 
Europe.89 
The foregoing problems are, of course, not new, and there exist 
no ready solutions. Aside from continuing to educate and to 
engage in public history, I can think of three immediate objectives 
for us to carry out. First, we need simply to continue to do new 
research in order to animate and ‘add flesh’ to Ottoman history 
and thus provide fresh images for both academic and public con-
sumption. Second, we need to think of new comparative geog-
raphies in which Europe is not the sole referent. And third, while 
it is admittedly difficult to shift away from our defensive posture, 
it might perhaps be helpful if we were to cease invoking the 
decline thesis altogether. To change the terms of the debate, we 
may want to move beyond both decline and its discontents. As a 
collective venture by a group of young scholars, in this book we 
hope to achieve all three of these objectives.

The Perception of Saadabad: 
The ‘Tulip Age’ and Ottoman–
Safavid Rivalry 

Can Erimtan 

The construction of Saadabad and its attendant structures on the 
Kağıthane river beyond Istanbul’s city walls took place in the 
following sequence during Şevval 1134 (15 
July–12 August 
1722): the building project started with the clean-up (tanzif ü 
tettahur) of the river and subsequent transformation of a section 
into a regular canal of 1100 metres, the Cedvel-i Sim. Alongside 
the canal two rows of trees were planted, and next to the water 
an 
imperial summer palace (bir kasr-ı hümâyûn) (the actual 
Saadabad) was built on 30 ‘well-proportioned’ pillars (otuz aded 
sütûn-ı mevzûn 
üzerine). Opposite 
this 
apparently 
opulent 
dwelling, a large reflecting pool (pişgâhında bir havz-ı vâsi) was 
laid out. In this artificial pond three fountains, of which one was 
in the shape of a three-headed serpent, threw jets of water into 
the air.1 These were all features common to the practice of 
building gardens and garden palaces in the early modern Islamic 
world.2 The contemporary visitor Charles Perry (1698–1780)3 
wrote down the following evocative description in his travelogue:  

[This] pleasure-house, called Sadabat … is embellished in a 
very splendid elegant manner; its Roof is covered all over 
with Lead, resting upon little Arches, which are sustained 
by 30 small pillars: The Intercollumniations are filled with 

41 

 
"
52,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Sheets of green Canvas, which, when stretched out, may 
serve as umbrella’s [sic]. The Entrance is through a Pair of 
Brass Folding-doors … between the Pillars in each Space 
rises a Balustrade about Two Feet from the Ground, upon 
which was a Sofa of very rich Brocade; in the Middle is a 
lovely Fountain, which plays its Water through a Cluster of 
little gilded Pipes, starting out of a Marble Cistern, against 
a large gilt Wall hung with Tassels: From thence the water 
is reflected upon a noble Tivan, or ceiling, of gilded Fret-
work, which beats 
it down 
again 
in 
little 
sprinkling 
Showers.4 

Fatma Müge Göçek’s work is symptomatic of the conceptual 
confusion surrounding the appearance of Saadabad and the nature 
of 
the 
so-called 
‘Tulip Age’. 
In her 
aptly-titled book, East 
Encounters West, 
she 
deals with 
the Ottoman 
ambassador 
Yirmisekiz Çelebi Mehmed Efendi (who died in 1732), and his 
mission to Paris (from 7 October 1720 to 8 October 1721).5 She 
unabashedly claims that Saadabad’s ‘construction tried to imitate 
Versailles and Fontainebleau, which Mehmed Efendi had visited. 
Mehmed Efendi [even] brought back plans of these palaces to 
apply them in Constantinople’.6 By contrast, in his important work 
on Saadabad, the architect and architectural historian Sedad Hakki 
Eldem (1908–88) had in 1977 already stated that the building was 
completely congruent with the ‘Turkish tradition’, by which he 
obviously meant the Ottoman tradition.7 Although this remark 
discloses Eldem’s nationalist inclinations,8 his standing as a serious 
architect and scholar should warrant a cautious approach to the 
issue of Saadabad and its supposed reliance on French models. 
Given 
Saadabad’s 
character 
as 
a 
garden palace, which was 
apparently 
commonly 
encountered 
in 
the 
Islamic 
space 
and 
Ottoman world, it is difficult to believe that scholars persist in 
linking this Ottoman construction to French buildings.  
In the first part of this chapter I analyse the concept of a ‘Tulip 
Age’ from a historiographical point of view. The idea that the 
Ottoman empire went through a short-lived but highly productive 

42 

"
53,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

era of Westernization during Damad İbrahim Paşa’s tenure as 
sadr-i âzam (grand vizier) will be exposed as a product of 
intertextual cross-fertilization and teleological agendas. In the 
second section 
I reinterpret 
the building of Saadabad 
in an 
attempt to appreciate the actions of Damad İbrahim and his 
patron Sultan Ahmed III in the context of the Ottomans’ then 
current political and military concerns. In so doing I hope to 
illustrate that the Ottoman empire had at the time not necessarily 
been looking westward for inspiration. Rather than turning their 
attention to France, it is my belief that early eighteenth-century 
Ottomans were preoccupied with the lands of Iran and, to a lesser 
extent, with their Islamic contemporaries. As a corollary, I would 
like to offer a view of Saadabad that tries to hint at certain 
parallels with the architectural image of the Safavid empire, as 
constructed by Shah Abbas I (1588–1629) in Isfahan.9 
Intellectual developments during 
the 
second 
constitutional 
period in Ottoman history (1908–18) have in many ways influ-
enced the current practice of Ottoman historiography.10 Today’s 
emphasis on archivally-based research, for example, had a clear 
precursor in the activities of the Tarih-i Osmanî Encümeni (TOE), 
the state-sponsored academic 
institution 
for the study of the 
Ottoman past set up on 27 November 1909. The organization’s 
policy 
statement 
(İfâde-i Merâm), 
published 
in 
1326/1910, 
contains a section 
that states 
that research 
in 
the extensive 
Ottoman archive holdings (Hazine-i Evrak) opened in 1262/1846 
was to be an important element of its members’ activities.11 
Quite aside from research practices popularized in the early 
years of the twentieth century, a number of historiographical topoi 
were also established in that period of frenzied intellectual and 
political activity. The idea that the Ottomans started to look to the 
West 
for 
inspiration 
in 
the early 1700s 
is one of 
the more 
persistent of these 
intellectual 
legacies from the 
late-Ottoman 
period. Nowadays, it seems like common sense to assume that the 
outcome of the treaties of Karlowitz (1699) and of Passarowitz 
(1718) led some Ottomans to imitate the ways of the ‘infidel’ 
Franks. The words of the historian Bruce McGowan epitomize this 

43 

"
54,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

trend, for he argues that 
‘after a second round of punishment, 
ending with the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), we see the first 
evidence, at 
the very 
top of society, of experimentation with 
Western models’.12 
With respect to the survival of certain late-Ottoman historio-
graphical topoi, the writings of one of the most prolific members 
of the TOE would in particular prove to be very influential: these 
were the popular publications of Ahmed Refik [Altınay] (1880–
1937).13 This historian, who had been a well-known figure on the 
intellectual scene of early twentieth-century Istanbul, not only 
contributed to the written output of the TOE, but also published 
numerous articles in the popular press of his day. He was in 
particular associated with the daily İkdam. In the period between 
9 March and 4 April 1913/1328–9, he wrote and published his 
Lâle Devri or ‘The Tulip Age’ in serialized form in İkdam.14 The 
serialized 
book 
popularized 
his 
then 
unconventional 
understanding of the life and actions of Ahmed III’s grand vizier 
Damad İbrahim Paşa (1718–30). Ahmed Refik even gave Damad 
İbrahim’s tenure as grand vizier the colourful name ‘Tulip Age’.15 
In his daily instalments, he attempted to dislodge the then current 
negative perception of the Ottoman vizier as a sybarite – an image 
that had been 
firmly 
established by 
the 
eminent Ottoman 
statesman and historian Ahmed Cevdet (1822–95).  
Cevdet’s 
impressive Vekayi-i Devlet-i Aliyye-i Osmaniyye (or 
simply Tarih-i Cevdet), 
consisting of 12 volumes, 
appeared 
between 1270 and 1301 (1854 and 1884).16 It was 
the 
first 
printed book in the Ottoman world to deal critically with the 
reign of Ahmed III. In the first volume published in 1270 (1854), 
Cevdet deals with the development of Ottoman history prior to 
the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) in 12 separate entries called 
‘makâle’. The seventh and eighth makâle partially deal with 
Damad İbrahim Paşa.17 The relevant sentences in those sections 
display an 
image of the Ottoman vizier Damad İbrahim that 
shows him 
to have been a 
serious hedonist whose actions 
damaged the Ottoman state. Cevdet found this negative portrayal 
of İbrahim Paşa in the late eighteenth-century manuscript Mür’i’t-

44 

"
55,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

Tevârih, written by Şemdânizâde Süleyman Efendi, who died in 
1193 (1779).18 
Ahmed Cevdet’s agenda in writing his impressive work had 
been to explain the implementation of the Tanzimat in 1839, 
which was why he intimated that Damad İbrahim had been one of 
the men responsible for the decline of the Ottoman position. 
Ahmed Refik, however, was 
coming 
from 
a very different 
position. As an erstwhile member of the army and an active 
historian of the TOE, he was an Ottoman whose concern for the 
well-being of the empire was saddled in its past. In his writings he 
thus often tried to link the present to the past. In the 1930s the 
politician and intellectual Hasan Ali Yücel (1897–1961) coined 
the term telmihî tarih (allusive history) to describe Ahmed Refik’s 
methodology of employing the past to comment on the present.19 
In other words, Ahmed Refik’s methodology amounted to what 
one might today call ‘presentism’.20 And his book Lâle Devri was 
no exception.  
The Lâle Devri text depicts early eighteenth-century Istanbul as 
an Ottoman place imbued with a desire to imitate the best of the 
West. As an intellectual primarily concerned with the survival of 
the Ottoman empire, Ahmed Refik depicts 
the Ottomans as 
beneficiaries of European military guidance. A parallel with the 
early twentieth-century situation was provided by the German 
general Otto Liman von Sanders (1855–1929) who was appointed 
adviser to the Ottoman army in November 1913.21 Ahmed Refik’s 
text 
intimates 
that Damad 
İbrahim, 
falling 
short of 
actually 
appointing a European specialist, nevertheless experimented with 
European forms and models. Ahmed Refik’s depiction of Damad 
İbrahim shows an Ottoman statesman busy at work trying to 
update the army’s structures and weaponry.  
In what would appear to be a totally anachronistic fashion, the 
book Lâle Devri even mentions the Nizâm-i Cedid, ‘the new order’, 
in this context.22 Ahmed Refik’s source for this outrageous claim 
was a short piece on Damad İbrahim in Tayyarzâde Ahmed Atâ’s 
(1801–c.1880) Tarih.23 For biographical information on Damad 
İbrahim, Atâ had relied primarily on the eighteenth-century text 

45 

"
56,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Hadikat ül-Vüzerâ, which was published in 1854–5/1271.24 There, 
Dilaverzâde Ömer Efendi (who died in 1759/1172) had written the 
entry on Damad İbrahim and it contained no mention at all of army 
reforms or even the phrase Nizâm-i Cedid.25 Thus, it would seem 
that Tayyarzâde had been taking liberties in devising a ‘story’ that 
combined elements of the reign of Ahmed III with themes from 
Selim 
III’s day (1789–1807). The phrase Nizâm-i Cedid was 
nevertheless in currency prior to Selim III’s failed attempts to 
reform the Ottoman armies. The phrase appears in a book written 
by İbrahim Müteferrika (1674–1745), namely Usul ül-Hikem fi 
Nizâm ül-Ümem, published in 1732 (1144) during Mahmud I’s 
reign (1730–54).26 This book, an eighteenth-century version of the 
traditional Islamic genre of the Nasihatnâme, or ‘mirror for princes’, 
effectively contrasts the worlds of Islam and Christianity.27 The 
phrase Nizâm-i Cedid is employed in Usul ül-Hikem to explain the 
reasons behind 
the sudden successes of Austrian armies on 
Ottoman battlefields.28 But Atâ’s source, the Hadikat ül-Vüzerâ, 
mentions neither the phrase Nizâm-i Cedid nor Damad İbrahim’s 
efforts to establish a new order in the Ottoman empire.  
But aside from his spurious attempt to endow Damad İbrahim 
with a reformist vigour in the military field, Ahmed Refik also 
asserts that the vizier had been a cultural innovator, a modernizer 
who tried to acquaint the Oriental Ottomans with the fashions 
and 
styles of 
the Occident. The grand vizier’s decision 
to 
commission the imperial palace of Saadabad outside Istanbul’s 
city walls subsequently provided Ahmed Refik with an 
ideal 
opportunity to highlight the far-reaching vision of his protagonist 
Damad İbrahim.29 
Ahmed Refik loosely links the small-scale Ottoman building on 
the banks of the Kağıthane river with France’s royal palace of 
Versailles.30 However, 
in 
a 
later publication, Fatma 
Sultan 
(1331/1916), a monograph on Ahmed III’s daughter and Damad 
İbrahim’s wife, Ahmed Refik strengthens the connection between 
the French and Ottoman buildings hinted at in Lâle Devri by 
calling Saadabad a copy or imitation (taklid) of Versailles that the 
enlightened İbrahim Paşa had commissioned.31 Ahmed Refik is 

46 

"
57,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

not forthcoming with a source for this connection, but close 
reading reveals that the Ottoman historian had unscrupulously 
copied a sentence written by the French historian Albert Vandal 
(1853–1912). 
In his book on 
the Marquis de Villeneuve, 
published in 1887, Vandal mentions in passing that the grand 
vizier had ordered an imitation of Versailles to be built on the 
Kağıthane river.32 The Ottoman writer Ahmed Refik had clearly 
read Vandal’s Une Ambassade française en Orient sous Louis XV 
(1887), referring to 
it, as he did on another occasion 
in his 
monograph on Fatma Sultan. 
Ahmed Refik presents Ambassador Yirmisekiz Çelebi as the 
medium through which European ideas of ‘progress’, in this case 
the 
stylistic 
properties 
of Versailles, 
entered 
the Ottoman 
capital.33 Yirmisekiz Çelebi had been sent to Paris 
in 1133/4 
(1720/1). Adhering 
to a 
literary 
tradition established 
in 
the 
second half of the seventeenth century,34 on his return to Istanbul 
he put his impressions on paper in a takrir (report).35 This little 
book 
has 
subsequently 
received 
the 
lofty 
denomination 
sefâretnâme 
and has 
entered Ottoman historiography 
as 
an 
important text, which some even see as containing a manifesto on 
the desirability of European culture and civilization.36 
The 
relevant 
literature on 
the Ottomans 
is 
littered with 
narratives that construct a link between the treaty of Passarowitz 
(1718), Yirmisekiz Çelebi’s 
trip 
to Paris (1720–21) and 
the 
construction of Saadabad (1722). The chronological sequence 
appears persuasive and thus authors as varied as Göçek, Robert 
Olson and Münir Aktepe present Ahmed III and Damad İbrahim 
as enlightened patrons whose adherence 
to 
the principle of 
cultural modernization or 
rejuvenation necessarily 
led 
to 
a 
popular reaction managed by 
the backward religious classes, 
opposed to the West and its ‘progressive’ atmosphere.37 
In general, scholarly as well as more popular narratives dealing 
with the ‘Tulip Age’ almost invariably end dramatically with the 
Patrona Halil uprising of 1730 when rebels destroyed the palace 
of Saadabad. The prolific and multi-disciplinary academic Andrew 
Wheatcroft, for example, says that the outbreak of the rebellion 

47 

"
58,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

was ‘followed [by] two days of rioting, arson and looting – a 
sudden show of cultural xenophobia towards anything thought to 
be “frankish” (western)’.38 As a result, scholars regard the period 
that started with the conclusion of the Passarowitz Treaty (1718), 
and was followed by Yirmisekiz Çelebi’s Paris mission (1720–1) 
and the construction of Saadabad (1722), as ending in the Patrona 
Halil 
rebellion (1730). The chronological sequence of 1718, 
1720/1, 1722 and 1730 is thus moulded into a ‘well-made story’. 
A ‘well-made story’, in the words of the professor of comparative 
literature Ann Rigney, is as a ‘set of closely connected events 
forming a temporal whole with a well-marked beginning and 
[end] presented as if “telling itself” without the mediation of a 
retrospective narrator’.39 The story of the construction of Saad-
abad in 1722, which ended in the destruction of the palace in 
1730, is a good example of such a ‘well-made story’.  
The narrative of Ahmed III’s and Damad İbrahim’s supposed 
attempts to introduce Western forms into Istanbul’s urban fabric 
led 
some 
specialists working 
in 
the 
early 1970s, 
such 
as 
architectural historian Godfrey Goodwin, to refer to the project on 
the Kağıthane river as ‘pavilions [that] were Ottoman pomaded à la 
française’, elaborating that ‘the desire to copy Western ways and 
emerge from the restraints of a mediaeval past was genuine’.40 
Writing 
in 
the same period, historian Robert Olson sees 
the 
Ottoman empire and Christian Europe as undertaking a 
‘first 
serious attempt … to try to understand one another’ during the 
Tulip Age.41 Sentiments like these have led scholars to view the 
1718–30 sequence as containing ‘a cautionary tale of the perils of 
precocious modernization’, as quite recently critically recounted 
by Ariel Salzmann.42 
As a consequence, 
this persuasive narrative of 
‘precocious 
modernization’ has become 
the cornerstone of a 
teleological 
interpretation of Ottoman history that sees a move to the West as 
Turkey’s destiny. Scholars leaning towards accepting a priori a so-
called 
‘Tulip 
Age’ 
paradigm 
understand Damad 
İbrahim’s 
commission of the Versailles-inspired building of Saadabad as a 
provocative gesture that led religiously-inspired rebels to remove 

48 

"

any trace of infidel forms from the city’s architectural body. The 
destruction of Saadabad has become a ‘hard historical fact’, which 
proves 
that modernization understood as Westernization was 
taking place during the ‘Tulip Age’. Sociologist and political scien-
tist Şerif Mardin, who is renowned for his analytic insight into the 
relationships between religion, ideology and popular movements in 
Turkey, sees the Tulip Age as the beginning of ‘the Westernization 
of Ottoman statesmen and the Palace through various attempts to 
copy the pomp of Versailles and the 
libertinism of eighteenth 
century France’.43 
Current critical discourse on Ahmed III and Damad İbrahim 
sees the popular discontent with the introduction of architectural 
novelties as proving the existence of a centre–periphery dichot-
omy, with benevolent rulers trying to impose innovation on an 
unwilling populace steeped in religious bigotry and prejudice. Or, 
as Mardin put it, ‘when called to arms to prevent the subversion of 
traditional ways, [the people] responded’.44  
The 
academic 
community has 
accepted 
an 
assumed 
but 
unproven stylistic relationship between Versailles and Saadabad 
as a ‘hard historical fact’, which shows that the Ottomans had 
been moving West, away from the Ottoman tradition and cer-
tainties of 
Islam under 
the munificent 
leadership of Damad 
İbrahim. In 1994, for instance, the literary historian Kemal Silay 
postulated that ‘the first ardent desire of the ruling Ottomans for a 
secular country was manifested in the Tulip Period.’45 
So, had Ottoman culture been subject to direct Western influ-
ence during the early eighteenth century? Had early eighteenth-
century Ottomans really been moving away from Islam in an 
attempt to revive their society and civilization? 
Ahmed Refik, who coined the phrase ‘Tulip Age’ and introduced 
the Versailles narrative into Turkish literature, had simply copied 
the words of a French historian 
to describe 
the nature and 
makeup of Saadabad. From the second half of the twentieth 
century onwards, numerous historians and other writers have 
replicated Ahmed Refik’s stance on 
the benevolent and pro-
Western Damad 
İbrahim who commissioned Saadabad as a 

49 

"
60,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

physical exteriorization of his policy decisions. It hardly seems 
possible any more to accept at face value the existence of a Paris–
Istanbul axis suggested by 
the Versailles-inspired building of 
Saadabad.  
Ahmed Refik produced 
texts 
that performed a 
teleological 
function in that they claim parallels between the past and present, 
parallels not necessarily reflected in historical reality. His book 
Lâle Devri, for instance, publicizes the existence of a beneficial 
‘Tulip Age’ 
synonymous with 
a 
rapprochement between 
the 
Ottomans and the West. The appearance of Saadabad plays an 
important role in the rhetoric employed to give credence to the 
idea that prior to the Tanzimat (1839–76) there had already been 
a structured effort to introduce Europeanization into the Ottoman 
mainstream.  
The Saadabad topos thus symbolizes vital issues in Ottoman-
Turkish history 
and historiography, particularly 
the double 
concept of modernization and Westernization. As a result, con-
ceptualizing Ahmed 
III 
and Damad 
İbrahim’s 
architectural 
patronage involves more than just an episode in the socio-cultural 
and architectural history of Istanbul. The practice of historians 
and other intellectuals who have worked on Saadabad should be 
reassessed in the light of the theoretical and philosophical debates 
on the composition of historical narratives. The limited field of 
writing Ottoman history thus has to be related to the wider 
practice of writing historical texts and with the more extensive 
subject of historiography. Nowadays, 
it 
seems customary 
to 
question the role of the historian as an author of narratives 
purporting to be ‘faithful’ representations of past events, and thus 
to investigate the function of history texts as literary artefacts. The 
publication 30 years ago of Hayden White’s article, ‘The historical 
text as a literary artefact’, stimulated a debate on the extent to 
which history as a discipline can accurately recover and represent 
the content of the past.46 Hayden White’s narratological model of 
historical understanding would have it that historians select and 
impose a story line, or an emplotment as he calls it, derived from 
the present to write about the past. The past is something that 

50 

"
61,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

does not exist apart 
from a 
few 
traces and 
the historian’s 
imagination, an imagination that is subject to his or her rhe-
torical, metaphorical and ideological strategies of explanation. 
History, or historical narratives and representations, on the other 
hand are primarily the product of historians’ compositional skills, 
and thus firmly reside in texts and narratives produced to explain 
what happened in the past. The danger in accepting the validity of 
this narratological model is that historical texts in the end become 
totally 
‘self-referential’ and detached 
from 
the 
‘real past’. For 
example, Frank Ankersmit’s postmodernist approach holds that 
the meaning of historical representation 
‘is not found [in the 
traces from the past], but made in and by the text’.47 This thus 
holds 
that resultant historical narratives become exercises 
in 
composition, or simply stories, and not attempts to describe the 
past in its own terms. It seems plausible to state that the topos of 
the Versailles-inspired Saadabad in historiographical reconstruc-
tions of early eighteenth-century Istanbul functions as a setting 
for the story of the Westernist Damad İbrahim to unfold. The 
narrative of a Paris–Istanbul axis as contained in the ‘story’ of 
Saadabad could be seen as a construction, an invention that was 
thought to be plausible in view of the available ‘evidence’, or 
rather the selected sets of supposedly known historical ‘facts’ like 
the conclusion of the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), Yirmisekiz 
Çelebi’s mission to Paris (1720–21) and the building of Saababad 
(1722).  
I would like to offer a different interpretation of the Damad 
İbrahim and Saadabad episode 
in Ottoman history, using a 
different 
set of 
‘evidence’. This will necessarily also be an 
interpretation that cannot claim to be a truthful reflection of the 
past but 
that should be understood as an equally plausible 
rendering of the narrative of the building of Saadabad in 1722. 
This means that I accept that the validity of my narrative is 
equally delineated by 
its 
intertextuality. But, 
in contrast 
to 
Ankersmit’s beliefs, I contend that my new interpretation of the 
Saadabad narrative has validity beyond a purely 
intertextual 
discourse. Rather than being a ‘story’ of Damad İbrahim and his 

51 

"
62,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

‘new inclination to profit by European example’, as Harold Bowen 
described the Ottoman leadership’s changed world-view following 
the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718) in the Encyclopedia of Islam,48 my 
proposed new take on Saababad will attempt to connect the 
building with 
the 
representation of 
the Ottomans’ political, 
cultural and intellectual context. Although the original building 
of Saadabad was demolished under Mahmud II’s rule (1809–39), 
thus 
leaving no recourse to physical evidence, the remaining 
information available on the kasır will be weighed against well-
known samples of palatial and garden architecture following the 
types and models used 
in the building practices of the early 
modern Islamic world.  
I would like to begin with the simple commonplace statement 
that the Ottoman state was built on Islamic foundations, a state-
ment that bears repeating at this juncture. As Yaşar Ocak recently 
stated, in Ottoman studies scholars have traditionally focused on 
‘political-legal structures and institutions [of Islam], rather than 
on the ideology, beliefs and practical dimensions of Islam in the 
Ottoman 
context’.49 This 
recognition 
implies 
that Ottoman 
culture was not just steeped in the cultural idiom of Islam, but 
was rather part and parcel of the wider culture of Islam.  
Returning specifically to the building of Saadabad, one needs to 
bear in mind that the construction of canals, waterfalls, fountains 
and similar engineering projects was an 
important 
feature of 
building 
traditions 
in 
the premodern 
Islamic world. These 
enterprises were closely connected with 
the establishment of 
gardens and garden pavilions. In this respect Richard Etting-
hausen’s phrase about 
‘the ubiquitousness and popularity of 
horticulture in Islam’ has literally now become nothing but a 
cliché.50 The Ottomans’ Muslim contemporaries could claim 
important achievements in the field of garden-related waterworks 
– the Paradise Canal (Nahr-i Behisht) in the Mughal capital of 
Shahjahanabad, and the main canal (Shah Jub) in the middle of 
Chahar Bagh Avenue (Khiaban-i Chahar Bagh) 
in the Safavid 
capital, 
Isfahan. 
Individual scholars such as Eba Koch51 and 
Stephen Blake52 have 
investigated artistic and cultural 
links 

52 

"
63,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

between Mughal Shahjahanabad and Safavid Isfahan. But a pos-
sible Ottoman correlation has so far not received much serious 
study or consideration.53 
In the context of Ahmed III and Saadabad, a possible linkup 
between 
Istanbul 
and 
Isfahan 
seems 
appropriate given 
the 
longstanding proximity and enmity between the Ottomans and 
Safavids.54 The canal in the centre of Chahar Bagh Avenue leading 
into Isfahan was flanked by a double row of trees on either side, 
and the palace or reception pavilion of Chihil Sutun, a part of the 
same 
garden 
configuration 
as 
the Chahar Bagh 
complex,55 
originally built in 1647 by Shah Abbas II (1642–66), was erected 
on approximately twenty columns, which become forty when 
reflected in the pool opposite.56 
Recently, Shirine Hamadeh has also highlighted the ‘conceptual, 
if 
not 
formal, 
link 
between, 
on 
the 
one hand, 
Isfahan’s 
Chaharbagh … and, on the other hand … Sacdabad’.57 In addition, 
it could be regarded as significant 
that 
in 
their 
layouts 
the 
Saadabad and Chihil Sutun buildings were given a 
specific 
number of columns.58 Their 
reflections 
in 
the 
Isfahan pool 
showed (approximately) forty columns; whereas, in Istanbul the 
reflections counted sixty. In 1942, the Byzantinist and archi-
tectural historian Richard Krautheimer (1897–1994) published a 
piece on the iconography of mediaeval architecture in which he 
argued that patrons of architecture in premodern societies often 
regarded ‘figures and numbers’ as important ‘among the elements 
which determine the relation between copy and original’.59 In the 
case of the relationship between Saadabad and Chihil Sutun, one 
could argue that the Ottomans’ attempt to build a kasır, arguably 
somewhat reminiscent of the Safavid reception pavilion Chihil 
Sutun, with more columns 
than 
its ostensible model can be 
interpreted as an Ottoman attempt to surpass the Safavid accom-
plishment. One 
could 
argue 
that 
the Ottoman design was 
deliberately conceived to humble the Safavid palace symbolically, 
albeit in a very subtle and ostensibly inconsequential way.  
Gülru Necipoğlu has convincingly demonstrated in one of her 
articles that symbolic interactions on an architectural plain were 

53 

"
64,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

not unheard of in an Ottoman context. In doing so, she also 
demonstrates that the Ottomans and Safavids were aware of their 
respective 
cultural 
vocabularies 
and 
architectural 
idioms. 
Necipoğlu specifically talks about sixteenth-century Istanbul and 
Selim I (1512–20), the sultan at the root of the Ottoman–Safavid 
rivalry. She starts off by stating that ‘the Ottoman garden tradition 
does not fit comfortably into the usual definitions of the so-called 
Islamic garden.’60 In particular, she refers to the ‘quadripartite 
formal gardens with 
straight water 
channels’, 
the 
so-called 
‘chaharbagh’ type, when making the aforementioned statement.61 
Mahvash Alemi describes this ‘type’ as a ‘garden quartered by two 
intersecting water channels’.62 Alemi declares that this particular 
scheme of garden layout was already considered a ‘particular type’ 
in the early sixteenth century, as Qasim Ibn Yusuf Abu Nasri 
Haravi unceremoniously mentions the chaharbagh as a model in 
his manuscript Irshad az-Zira’ah (921/1515).63 In other words, in 
the early sixteenth-century Islamic world one seems 
to have 
regarded the construction of ‘quadripartite formal gardens with 
straight water channels’ as common. The exception was formed 
by the Ottomans, who favoured designs ‘characterized by asym-
metrical open compositions with an outward-looking orientation 
… in Istanbul … relatively informal landscapes with understated 
symmetry and axiality were … common’.64 
Necipoğlu nevertheless goes on to say that there was ‘at least 
one example of a Persianate chaharbagh among the suburban 
gardens of sixteenth-century Istanbul … the Karabali garden in 
Kabataş’.65 In the context of sixteenth and seventeenth-century 
Istanbul, the Bagçe-i Karabâli,66 as a quadripartite formal garden, 
stands out 
from 
the numerous other 
gardens 
and 
garden 
structures adhering to the classical Ottoman tradition. In view of 
its rather extraordinary nature in the context of Istanbul gardens 
and garden layouts, Necipoğlu argues that the Bagçe-i Karabâli 
with 
its deliberate Persianate 
character 
‘was 
created … 
to 
commemorate [Sultan Selim I’s] victorious Persian campaign’, 
which in 1514 crushed the Safavid forces of Shah Ismacil I (1501–
24).67 This sixteenth-century example of the cultural effects of the 

54 

"
65,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

political and ideological Ottoman–Safavid rivalry68 could be used 
as 
a 
template 
for 
a 
new 
interpretation 
of 
Saadabad, 
an 
interpretation that involves Ottoman interaction with the cultural 
modes of Safavid Iran rather 
than with 
those of eighteenth-
century France.  
The parallels 
between 
the Cedvel-i 
Sim 
and 
Saadabad 
in 
Kağıthane, on the one hand, and certain aspects of the archi-
tectural image of Safavid Isfahan,69 notably the Chihil Sutun and 
the Khiaban-i Chahar Bagh, on the other, could be employed to 
furnish a different narrative of Ahmed III, Damad İbrahim Paşa and 
the Ottoman refurbishment of an area beyond Istanbul’s city walls. 
My narrative also takes an ambassadorial mission into account. 
In the year 1132 (1720) Damad İbrahim’s government dispatched 
Dürrî Ahmed Efendi to Tehran, where the Safavid court then 
resided.70 During the reign of Ahmed III’s Iranian contemporary, 
Shah Sultan Husain (1694–1722), the territorial coherence of the 
Safavid dominions became more and more difficult to support. By 
the early 1720s internal incursions had become rife in Iran and 
the Ottoman ambassador was thus called upon to give details of 
the actual state of the Safavids’ affairs.71 On his return to Istanbul, 
Dürrî Efendi composed a 
report 
(takrir) 
that described 
the 
desperate 
situation of 
the 
Safavids 
in 
the 
face of 
internal 
instability 
and 
rising unrest 
among various of 
the 
Safavid 
dominions’ population groups.72 In Safer 1134 (December 1721) 
Shah Sultan Husain 
responded 
to 
the Ottoman delegate by 
sending an ambassador, Murteza Kuli Khan, to Istanbul. Damad 
İbrahim Paşa 
impressed 
the envoy with displays of cultural 
splendour, such as 
feasts at elegant kiosks 
interspersed with 
presentations of samples of Ottoman calligraphy set against a 
background of the finest Ottoman music, and displays of the 
Ottomans’ military prowess 
through demonstrations of newly 
built three-decked galleons equipped with heavy artillery.  
The Safavid 
ambassador Murteza Kuli Khan 
remained 
in 
Istanbul 
from 5 Rebiyülevvel 
to 16 Cemaziyelâhir 1134 (24 
December 1721 to 3 April 1722). As soon as he left the capital 
İbrahim Paşa called a meeting of the great divan in which a 

55 

"
66,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

decision was made 
to go 
to war.73 And approximately 
three 
months after his departure, in the course of the month of Şevval 
1134, which corresponded to the period 
from 15 July to 12 
August 1722, Saadabad was constructed. The building was set up 
in an area that had been popular as an excursion spot since the 
reign of Murad IV (1623–39). 
Meanwhile, Shah Sultan Husain was fighting a losing battle with 
Afghan rebels under Mir Mahmud’s leadership and eventually, on 
12 Muharrem 1135 (23 October 1722), Mir Mahmud forced the 
Safavid Shah to abdicate.74 In Istanbul, this seems to have led the 
Şeyhülislâm Yenişehirli Abdullah Efendi (who died in 1743) to 
issue a fetva declaring the war against the heretics of Iran to be 
lawful 
and 
desirable 
in 
the months 
from Muharrem 
to 
Rebiyulevvel 1135 (October–December 1722)75 – ‘evidence’ that 
presents us with an opportunity to provide a new interpretation of 
Saadabad. The sequence of the above events (namely 1720, 1721 
and 1722) helps one to understand Saadabad in the context of the 
culture and value system of the Ottomans and of the wider early 
modern Islamic world. The traditional enmity between the Sunni 
Ottomans and the Shici Safavids provides an intra-Islamic dimension 
to a reassessment of the construction of Ahmed III’s summer palace 
outside Istanbul’s city walls and a re-evaluation of the so-called 
‘Tulip Age’ in Ottoman history.  
Rather 
than acknowledge 
that 
the Safavid 
state had been 
overthrown, 
the Ottoman government couched 
its 
territorial 
desires in language that implied that Ahmed III as defender of 
Sunni 
Islam was 
fighting Shah Sultan Husain, 
the Qizilbash 
champion of heresy. Shah Sultan Husain had been a ruler who 
pursued extremely oppressive religious policies against Sunni 
Muslims, mystics and other 
religious minorities, policies 
that 
included forcible conversion to Shici Islam. The shah also cultivated 
his personal piety by, for example, performing highly publicized 
pilgrimages to saints’ shrines, and even creating a new post, the 
mulla-bashi (instituted 1124/1712), in the palace hierarchy that was 
meant to secure his personal moral and spiritual rectitude.76 But 
aside from dealing with such lofty concerns about Islam as an 

56 

"
67,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

ideological determinant, one 
could 
also 
look 
at 
the 
shah’s 
architectural patronage as warranting a possible linkup between 
Saadabad and the Chihil Sutun. Shah Sultan Husain patronized 
the construction of new buildings as well as the restoration and 
refurbishment of already existing works. Especially relevant in this 
context seems to have been his refurbishment of the Chihil Sutun. 
At the beginning of the eighteenth century the palace had been 
destroyed by fire and, after this disaster, the shah had the palace 
rebuilt 
in 
the year 1115 
(1703). According 
to Tadeusz 
Jan 
Krusinski (1675–1756), a priest who was present in Isfahan at the 
time, this was done ‘with more Splendor than the former [version of 
the Chihil Sutun]’.77 
It is important to remember that Saadabad was built at a time 
when the Ottomans seem to have thought that a final resolution 
of the Ottoman–Safavid rivalry could be attained. The actual 
building work was started and completed within the space of the 
month of Şevval 1134 (between 15 July and 12 August 1722), and 
was a relatively light, inexpensive and easy-to-build pavilion. In 
adhering to this form of architectural patronage, Damad İbrahim 
and Ahmed III seem to have continued a building tradition that had 
first been practised under Mehmed IV (1648–83), Sultan Ahmed’s 
notorious father. Sedad Hakki Eldem remarks that Sultan Mehmed 
IV ‘gave a new turn to kiosk building’ in that he patronized methods 
of construction 
that were 
lighter and 
less expensive 
than had 
previously been the case when heavy constructions of ashlar and 
bricks were used for domestic architecture (roughly between the 
1450s and 1640s).78 
But Saadabad’s ‘light’ character might also compare with the 
Safavid Chihil Sutun. After all, Robert Hillenbrand remarks that 
the Chihil Sutun has a ‘deliberately unstable and impermanent air’ 
that he links to the general nature of secular Safavid architecture, 
which he calls 
‘ostentatiously 
frail’.79 Shah Sultan Husain had 
associated his name with 
the palace 
in 
Isfahan, and Damad 
İbrahim attached his patron Ahmed III’s name to the construction 
on the Kağıthane river. Thus, in a retrospectively historiographic 
fashion, one could posit that the construction of Saadabad, which 

57 

"
68,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

contained a number of allusions to Isfahan and its structures, was 
a cultural declaration of the Ottomans’ political and military 
resolve to conquer the lands of Iran. Ahmed III spent a lot of his 
time 
in Saadabad, where he held numerous 
feasts and other 
pastimes. The chronicler Küçük Çelebizâde İsmail Asım Efendi, 
who died in 1173 (1760) noted in his Tarih numerous festive 
occasions organized at Saadabad.80 
A contemporary illustration of the Ottoman appreciation and 
acclaim of Saadabad can also be found in one of the songs (şarkı) 
written by Ahmed 
III’s court poet Nedim (1681–1730). The 
composition extols the attraction and beauty of Saadabad set 
within the framework of Ottoman–Safavid rivalry: ‘Come a while 
and let [your] gaze wander, it is not forbidden to the eye Now 
Saadabad has become my favoured hill above garden. [Saadabad’s] 
hill [and] garden have equalled 
Isfahan’s Chahar Bagh Now 
Saadabad has become my favoured hill above garden.’81 
At the outset of the song Nedim invites the listener to wander 
around the surroundings of Saadabad. In the following lines the 
beauty of the 
layout 
is underlined, while the gardens of the 
Chahar Bagh in Isfahan by comparison are said to have lost their 
attraction and charm. The quoted first strophe of Nedim’s song 
portrays Damad İbrahim’s commission for his patron Ahmed III 
to have clearly surpassed the earlier accomplishments of Shah 
Abbas I in Isfahan. Members of the Ottoman elite visiting the 
mesire excursion spot at Kağıthane may well have heard or even 
sung this tune, while enjoying themselves. The song is a eulogy to 
Damad İbrahim as a patron of the arts, and of his ability to 
commission architectural constructions able 
to challenge 
the 
Safavids’ well-known accomplishments in Isfahan.  
In an inter-dynastic context, however, it seems fair to say that in 
the minds of their contemporaries the figure of the Sadr-ı Âzam 
was easily replaced by that of his patron, Sultan Ahmed III. 
Hence, one could argue that the Ottoman Ahmed III competed in 
a symbolic rivalry with his Safavid counterpart Shah Sultan 
Husain. This symbolic rivalry was valid on a number of levels: in 
ideological terms, Ahmed III presented himself as the champion 

58 

"
69,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

of the Sunni cause, who, in visual terms, challenged the Safavids 
through his ostentatious dislays of Ottoman wealth, culture and 
refinement at the attractive palace of Saadabad so reminiscent of 
the Chihil Sutun in Isfahan. That Ahmed III’s kasır carried an 
ostentatiously Persianate name seems 
to underline a possible 
connection with Ottoman designs on the lands of Iran. 
Another symbolic Ottoman gesture ostensibly directed at the 
Safavids was constituted by the Ottoman government’s estab-
lishment of a tile workshop at Tekfur Sarayı in Istanbul during 
Damad İbrahim’s tenure. Previously, the Ottomans had relied on 
the tile kilns at Iznik, established in the mid-sixteenth century, to 
supply them with high-quality glossy underglaze tiles in a colour 
spectrum of turquoise, blue and red against a white background. 
According to Gülru Necipoğlu, these tiles formed a ‘decorative 
skin’ that was strikingly different from the decorative appearance 
of 
the 
‘Timurid world’, which was preserved 
‘with different 
emphases … by the Safavids and Uzbeks’.82 By Ahmed III’s reign, 
the Iznik workshops were no longer producing any tiles, but 
Damad İbrahim’s administration appeared to favour a revival of 
these specific tiles, which in Necipoğlu’s words had become ‘a 
stamp of Ottoman identity’. She continues by saying that Ahmed 
III’s court historian Küçük Çelebizâde clearly stated in his Tarih 
that it was his patrons’ ‘wish to revive [the] textile-like ceramics 
of Iznik (kumaş-i kaşi gibi münakkaş ve hoş kumaş kaşiler) that led 
to the establishment of the workshop at Tekfur Sarayı’.83 One 
could argue that Ahmed III and Damad İbrahim, in this instance, 
tried to secure the continued existence of a particular type of 
Ottoman visual 
language: a visual 
idiom 
that was meant 
to 
differentiate them from the Safavid image, still beholden to the 
norms established by Timur (1336–1402) who had defeated and 
humiliated the Ottomans in 1402.84 
In other words, it would seem that, on a cultural plane, early 
eighteenth-century Ottomans appeared very preoccupied with 
their eastern neighbours.85 In this connection, it seems equally 
significant that in Istanbul a committee was set up to translate the 
Persian historian Ghiyath 
ad-Din Muhammad Khwandamir’s 

59

70,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

(1475–c.1535) Habib as-Siyar 
fi Akhbar Afrad al-Bashar (929/ 
1523) 
into Ottoman. Throughout the 1720s, Ottoman patrons 
encouraged the translation of literary works that had hitherto been 
inaccessible to Ottoman audiences.86 Intellectuals working on the 
Habib as-Siyar comprised such figures as Mansurizâde, Fasihi 
Hasan, Nahifi Mustafa, Sadi Efendi and Sheikh Musa Dede.87 
Their project must have carried a special significance 
in the 
context of the then current Ottoman interest in the lands of Iran. 
The book describes the political events of Iran until the reign of 
Shah Ismacil (1501–24), the founder of the Safavid state. Also, for 
each historical period the author included an appendix with the 
biographies of notable writers and poets of the age. In all, no 
fewer than 211 individual figures are treated in this way.88 By 
means of this book, the Ottoman court was able to familiarize 
itself with the cultural and political heritage of Iran, which was 
supposed to form part of the Ottoman sphere of influence because 
of Sultan Ahmed’s occupation of the former Safavid dominions.  
Quite apart from the above-mentioned cultural factors indicat-
ing an Ottoman preoccupation with Iran, one should also not 
underestimate 
the 
religious 
and 
ideological 
aspects 
of 
the 
Ottoman–Safavid rivalry. The Şeyhülislâm Abdullah Efendi issued 
a fetva supporting the Ottoman sultan’s claims to the caliphate in 
1138 (1726), demonstrating that Ahmed III took seriously his 
title as defender of Sunni Islam. In his fetva Abdullah Efendi 
argues that Ahmed III’s appropriation of the title was legitimate 
because he had made conquests with the sword.89 This line of 
argument resembles that of Ebussuud Efendi, in office from 952 
to 982 (1545–74), who had earlier reasoned that the Ottoman 
sultan, as the most powerful potentate in the Islamic world, was 
in 
a position 
legally 
to 
call himself 
the 
‘Successor of 
the 
Prophet’.90 The above 
‘story’ of Ottomans, Safavids, summer 
palaces and Islamic rectitude seems to constitute a plausible way 
of reinterpreting the construction of Saadabad in 1722. 
The new narrative I present of the role of Damad İbrahim in 
Ottoman history is, however, in sharp contrast with the received 
wisdom on Saadabad and the so-called ‘Tulip Age’. The traditional 

60 

"
71,"THE PERCEPTION OF SAADABAD 

understanding of Ahmed III’s era is nicely encapsulated by the 
entry on the ‘Lâle Devri’ in the well-respected new edition of the 
Encyclopedia of Islam: Damad İbrahim’s term of administration 
constituted ‘a serious movement towards a secular society’. Along 
those 
lines, 
Saadabad 
is 
thought of 
as 
‘a new palace … 
constructed on French plans’. The recognition of Saadabad’s 
supposed French origins seems to indicate that the Ottomans had 
at the time been contemplating an ideological move to the West, a 
move away 
from 
the Islamic world. This Versailles narrative 
subsequently holds that a popular uprising, the so-called Patrona 
Halil rebellion, put an untimely stop to this premature form of 
Westernization. The composite Tarih-i Sâmî ü Şâkir ü Subhî 
(1198/1784) 
indicates, however, 
that 
the 
rebels had 
been 
unsuccessful 
in 
their attempts 
to destroy Saadabad and 
the 
attendant kasırs. The 
vakanüvis Mustafa Sâmî 
recorded 
the 
wording of an imperial writ issued by Mahmud I that indicated 
that the sultan did not want the rebels to burn down the site 
(ihtirâk) allowing (ruhsat ve iznim) them to enact some minor acts 
of destruction and damage (hedim ve tahribi).91 
The proverbial coupling of ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ is a key 
feature in traditional appreciations of early eighteenth-century 
Ottoman culture. The academic community regards the ‘Tulip 
Age’ as a kind of harbinger of the idea that modernization is 
synonymous with Westernization in an Ottoman-Turkish con-
text, and it depicts the small-scale palace of Saadabad as giving 
physical shape to this otherwise unverified notion. The received 
wisdom on the issue thus holds that early eighteenth-century 
Istanbul had seen a marked move towards ‘change’. On the other 
hand, my alternative perception of Saadabad does not aim to 
burden the small palace with any ideological significance beyond 
Ahmed III and Damad İbrahim’s Ottoman and Islamic contexts – 
their own cultural framework. In the end, the new ‘story’ that I 
presented here finds more credibility in an Ottoman past that 
persisted in its habits, unprovoked as it were, than in one that all 
of a sudden 
turned 
its 
face 
to 
the West. My 
‘story’ of 
the 
construction of Saadabad holds that it was conceived as a building 

61 

"
72,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

containing conscious allusions to the Safavid architectural image. 
Rather than claiming a Safavid inspiration for Saadabad, it is my 
belief 
that Damad 
İbrahim 
and Ahmed 
III were 
cultured 
Ottomans who were consciously reaffirming their allegiance to 
the cultural world of the early modern Islamic world by creating 
kasır 
that 
functioned as a visual reminder of 
the Ottomans’ 
designs on the lands of Iran. Rather than implying that Yirmisekiz 
Çelebi Mehmed Efendi had made his patrons susceptible to the 
delights and pleasures of the Christian world of Europe, the 
sultan 
and his 
grand 
vizier proved 
to be 
fully 
cognizant 
inhabitants of the early modern Islamic world. I would thus like 
to claim that Ahmed III and Damad İbrahim had been conven-
tional Ottomans in cultural and ideological terms, Ottomans who 
tried to stay connected with the traditions of their ancestry, and 
whose cultural patronage and political programmes disclosed a 
willingness to fashion a continuity and sense of cohesion with the 
wider culture and intellectual heritage of the early modern world 
of Islam.

The First Ottoman Turkish 
Printing Enterprise: Success or 
Failure? 

Orlin Sabev (Orhan Salih) 

In the final scene of Jale Baysal’s play, Cennetlik İbrahim Efendi 
(İbrahim Efendi in Paradise), the man who was a member of the 
Müteferrika corps at the Ottoman court,1 but who became known 
for establishing the first Ottoman Turkish printing press in 1726, 
İbrahim Müteferrika is found on his deathbed complaining to the 
court poet Nevres, ‘There will be in inheritance piles of unsold 
books. They did not read what I printed.’2 
In 1986, the script of this play, which is an adaptation of the 
biography of the first Ottoman printer, İbrahim Müteferrika, won 
first prize in a theatre competition organized by the Foundation 
of the Turkish State Theatre and Ballet (Devlet Tiyatrosu ve Bale 
Çalışanları Vakfı – TOBAV). Unfortunately, we do not know 
whether the play was ever staged, but we do know that it was 
published in 1992. As a literary adaptation meant for perform-
ance, the play, perhaps expectedly, is a mixture of fact and fiction, 
with fiction utilized to ‘fill in the gaps’ of the factual details of the 
narrative, rendering it, as Christine Brook-Rose calls it, a ‘history 
palimpsest’.3 In ‘history palimpsest’ fiction tends to overwrite real 
historical events, thereby presenting an alternative version that is 
perhaps more entertaining and attractive to the reading public 
and/or audience, but 
less satisfying to the historian. In these 
instances, fiction obfuscates ‘what really happened’.

Here I am not trying to discuss the historical accuracy or artistic 
merits of Jale Baysal’s play, but rather to take its final episode as a 
starting point for the present discussion. Baysal’s depiction of 
İbrahim Müteferrika’s desperate final words about the failure of 
his book printing 
enterprise 
is one 
instance of 
a 
‘history 
palimpsest’.  
Strikingly, the impression of the failure of Müteferrika’s effort 
does not originate in semi-fictitious literary works such as Baysal’s 
but 
in 
the 
first 
academic 
study 
of 
İbrahim Müteferrika’s 
biography, namely Imre Karácson’s article published in 1910.4 
Karácson cites a 
letter by 
the Catholic Hungarian nobleman 
Czezarnak (César) de Saussure who, as a companion of Ferenc 
Rákoczi during his exile to the Ottoman empire (1717–35), met 
İbrahim Müteferrika in Turkey in 1732. In this letter he stated 
that Müteferrika’s profits were rather moderate.5 So, Karácson 
took de Saussure’s remark at face value and presented Müteferrika 
as a disappointed pioneer who had been unable to reap the fruits 
of his labour.6 
César de Saussure’s 
aforementioned 
letter was written 
in 
February 1732 and it provides one of the few sources of bio-
graphical 
data 
about Müteferrika. Although 
a 
subject 
of 
controversy in modern historiography,7 until very recently this 
letter was the only source available that gave some idea of the 
commercial success of 
the 
first Ottoman printing enterprise. 
According to de Saussure, Müteferrika’s press was unsuccessful 
because of insufficient sales, which he attributed to the limited 
number of literate Turks, a lack of interest in reading and the 
relatively high price of printed books. The author mentions that 
there was a fear that the enterprise would be suspended after 
İbrahim Müteferrika’s death, 
for no Turk would 
take on an 
undertaking with such 
low profits.8 Much 
later (in 
fact after 
1759) de Saussure added to his 1732 letter a note that İbrahim 
Müteferrika had died in 1738 and left nothing but piles of books. 
He added that such a legacy only made his descendants feel an 
aversion to resuming the enterprise. (‘Ce qui a tellement dégoûté 
ses successeurs ou héritiers qu’ils ont entièrement abandonné son 

64 

"
75,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

imprimerie.’)9 The exact date of the appended note is unknown, 
but the year of İbrahim Müteferrika’s death given by de Saussure 
is incorrect. Rather than 1738, Müteferrika actually died a good 
eight or nine years later (in 1746 or 1747).10 Given this error, the 
fact that we are unsure whether de Saussure was an eye witness to 
Müteferrika’s death and the consequent situation of his printing 
house, we may legitimately ask if de Saussure’s version is yet 
another ‘history palimpsest’ that overwrites the real events.  
Given 
the paucity of sources on 
the subject, scholars and 
litterateurs alike had no option other than to refer to de Saussure’s 
‘observations’, while in the process giving his version credibility. 
The first was the above-mentioned Imre Karácson,11 followed by 
people such as Lajos Hopp,12 Jale Baysal and Hidayet Nuhoğlu, 
the 
latter 
two 
referring 
to Karácson’s 
quotation 
after 
de 
Saussure.13 
Since Karácson’s article of 1910, scholars have accepted the 
claim that İbrahim Müteferrika’s enterprise was rather unsuc-
cessful and invested their efforts in searching for, and speculating 
about, the reasons for this alleged failure. Niyazi Berkes, a well-
known specialist in Ottoman social history, points out three main 
conditions conducive to the successful progress of any printing 
undertaking, namely technological development, the production 
of the quantity of paper appropriate 
for the requirements of 
printing, and 
the existence of 
the necessary reading public. 
According to Berkes, these three conditions were absent in the 
Ottoman milieu. He also underlines the relatively high prices of 
the first Ottoman printed books and the nature of their subjects. 
He argues 
that 
the 
latter 
rendered 
the books 
insufficiently 
attractive to the majority of the reading public whose education 
was most likely attained through Islamic religious learning, such 
as 
the medrese 
students. Berkes 
concludes 
that 
the 
limited 
technical and restrictive economic conditions were responsible for 
the weak influence of the first Ottoman printing enterprise.14 
A similar view is shared by A. D. Jeltyakov, who attributes the 
alleged failure of Müteferrika’s venture to cultural and techno-
logical underdevelopment. Not only does he see the illiteracy 

65 

"
76,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

prevalent in Ottoman society as an obstacle to the success of 
printing, but also conjectures that the literate elements of the 
population were uninterested in topics in the exact sciences of the 
kind Müteferrika printed.15 
A combination of the above-mentioned views can also be found 
in J. S. Szyliowicz’s 1988 article on the subject, in which the first 
Ottoman printing 
enterprise 
is 
considered 
in 
terms of 
the 
different social, economic and cultural conditions prevailing in 
western Europe and the Ottoman empire respectively. According 
to Szyliowicz, compared with western Europe, the Ottoman social 
climate was unsuitable for such an undertaking because of both 
mass illiteracy and the opposition of the numerous professional 
manuscript copyists who viewed the printing press as a threat to 
their profession.16 
Hüseyin Gazi Topdemir, author of one of the most recent 
monographs on İbrahim Müteferrika, assuming 
the 
failure of 
Müteferrika’s project, 
stresses 
the 
same 
reasons, namely 
the 
paucity or the prohibitively high cost of printing paper, the low 
output of Müteferrika’s printing press, the availability of printed 
books only to select individuals, the books’ topics not meeting the 
public’s expectations and, finally, their relatively high cost in 
comparison with that of manuscripts.17 
Topdemir’s reference to the high prices of the first Ottoman 
printed books comes from an article by Osman Ersoy that is 
especially devoted 
to 
that 
issue. Ersoy, who 
is a prominent 
scholar of the history of Ottoman printing, concludes that the 
prices of the books printed 
in Müteferrika’s typography were 
quite high given the average Ottoman standard of living in the 
first half of the eighteenth century. According to Ersoy, along 
with 
the constant paucity of printing paper and well-trained 
printers, high prices must have been a significant factor behind 
the alleged failure of the first Ottoman printing enterprise.18 
Ersoy’s article was published in a volume on the proceedings of 
a symposium dedicated to the 250th anniversary of Turkish book 
printing, which was held 
in Ankara 
in December 1979. The 
volume also includes the symposium participants’ comments on 

66 

"
77,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

the papers presented and Ersoy’s paper seems to have sparked a 
lively discussion. One of 
the participants, Şerafettin Turan, 
pointed out a methodological flaw in Ersoy’s paper in that the 
prices of the first Ottoman printed books should be compared 
with manuscript prices, as found in the probate inventories of 
deceased Muslims, rather 
than measured against 
the average 
standard of living. Turan’s implication is that printed book prices 
should be seen in the context of the book market in general, 
whether manuscript or printed. Thus, the cost of printed books 
should be measured against the standard of living of those who 
owned manuscript books, namely 
the reading public. Turan 
added also that the first Ottoman printed books must have had a 
public with specific reading interests and a higher standard of 
living.19 
Şerafettin Turan’s remarks are insightful in their insistence on 
empirical research and the utilization of the rich and massive 
Ottoman sources of the probate inventories (tereke defteri). Oddly 
enough, although these documents have been widely used for 
exploring social and economic aspects of the history of Ottoman 
everyday life in different periods,20 except for a few early studies, 
dealing only partially with the presence of books 
in probate 
inventories,21 they have only recently attracted the attention of 
students of Ottoman book history.22 This attention, however, has 
been overwhelmingly devoted 
to studying 
the circulation of 
manuscripts rather 
than of printed books. And 
if Turan did 
significantly point to the importance of probate inventories in 
Ottoman book history, it seems that he failed to consider the 
probate inventory of the most important personality of Ottoman 
printed book history, namely of İbrahim Müteferrika.  
I have been fortunate enough to come across precisely that – the 
probate 
inventory 
relating 
to 
the 
possessions 
of 
İbrahim 
Müteferrika, preserved in the Mufti Archives of Istanbul,23 in the 
collection Kısmet-i Askeriye Mahkemesi (register 98, folios 39a–
40b). This source, dated 20 Rebiü’l-ahir 1160 (1 April 1747), is 
thus 
far the most 
illuminating with regard to many hitherto 
unknown 
aspects 
of Müteferrika’s personality 
and printing 

67 

"
78,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

activities.24 
Since 
the 
document 
provides 
an 
inventory 
of 
Müteferrika’s possessions at the time of his death, 
it gives a 
relatively accurate idea of how many unsold copies of printed 
books were 
left 
in his possession. An 
interpretation of these 
figures of unsold copies, and their juxtaposition with the total 
number of initial prints made, not only allows us to gauge the 
degree of success or failure of Müteferrika’s printing project, but 
also, subsequently, to see to what extent the discussions and 
speculations about the ‘failure’ of the first Ottoman printing press 
have 
been warranted. 
Thus, 
a 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
the 
Müteferrika printing venture is in order. Through the analysis, I 
propose to explore the following issues:  

(cid:137) 

(cid:137) 

(cid:137) 

(cid:137) 

a juxtaposition of print figures to sale figures in order to judge 
the commercial outcomes of the Müteferrika press;  
an assessment of the popularity of the titles;  
a contextualization of the findings by relating them to the 
book market and the reading public; and finally 
a reassessment of the significance of the first Ottoman printing 
press.  

But before we get to the subject, there are several issues to be 
considered. The first has to do with what is meant by the term 
‘success’ when used in reference to the first Ottoman printing 
press. If we are speaking of commercial success, then the term 
implies not only good sales figures but also a good turnover of the 
investments made. However, if we use the term in a broader 
sense, we need to consider the printing press as a cultural product 
and look at the extent to which the technological innovation is 
adopted or rejected by society at large. While I deal with the latter 
in the conclusion to this chapter, on the question of commercial 
success it is difficult to assess to what extent the net proceeds of 
the sales actually covered the investments Müteferrika had made. 
For now, it would be reasonable to turn our attention to sales 
figures because they reflect printing as a mutual process in which 
the printer/seller and the reading public/customers are involved.  

68 

"
79,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

Another issue has to do with problems related to the sources 
used for this research. The above-mentioned inventory provides 
the number of printed books left on Müteferrika’s death (2981 in 
total); however, it does so partly by listing individual titles and 
partly by 
listing 
groups of 
titles. Given 
this 
classificatory 
inconsistency, it is impossible to calculate the number of unsold 
copies of each publication; one can only do so for those that are 
listed individually, which is roughly half the titles. Thus, although 
I 
shall be unable 
to 
assess 
the popularity of 
each of 
the 
Müteferrika press titles, I am able to include these titles in the 
total figures, which is relevant for gauging the overall success of 
the Müteferrika printing enterprise.  
Of course, book sale figures would be almost meaningless if not 
juxtaposed with figures for the total number of initial printed 
copies. Fortunately, we can find the relevant information in a 
source 
other 
than 
the 
above-mentioned probate 
inventory, 
namley a book printed at the Müteferrika press – El-Cildü’s-sāni 
min Tārīh-i Naсīmā (second volume of History of Naсima). This 
book happens 
to be 
the 
thirteenth of 
the Müteferrika press 
editions, and provides the number of copies for each previous title 
published by the press except for one book – Grammaire turque ou 
Méthode courte & facile pour Apprendre la Langue turque (Turkish 
Grammar or a Concise and Easy Method of Learning the Turkish 
language) 
by Holdermann 
(1730).25 The 
author, 
however, 
provides 
figures 
for 
the 
initial print number of 
the 
latter. 
Unfortunately, we have no documentation for the total print of 
the last three of Müteferrika’s 16 editions, namely Raşid Efendi’s 
Tārīh  (History) in three volumes, along with Çelebizade Efendi’s 
appendix (zeyl) Tārīh (printed in 1741), Ömer Bosnavi’s Ahvāl-i 
Gazavāt der Diyār-i Bosna (The State of Religious Wars in the 
Province of Bosnia) of 1741, and the two-volume Persian–Turkish 
dictionary, Lisānü’l-cAcem or Ferheng-i Şucūrī, of 1742. However, 
one may suggest that each had a run of at least 500 copies since it 
is the minimum number of copies of the initial prints found in the 
above-mentioned list (indeed, ten of the sixteen editions whose 
initial print number we know is at 500 copies). 

69 

"
80,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Thus, figures for both the total initial print and final numbers of 
the unsold copies exist for six of the Müteferrika press titles, 
namely Vankulu’s Arabic–Turkish dictionary of 1729, Nazmizade 
Efendi’s Gülşen-i Hulefā (Rosary of Caliphs) of 1730, Grammaire 
turque, Kātip Çelebi’s Kitāb-ı Cihānnümā (Mirror of the World, 
1732) and Takvīmü’t-Tevārīh (Calendar of Histories, 1733) and 
Naсima’s Tārīh (1734).  
The category of books for which we know the initial total print 
but where the number of unsold copies is given in groups rather 
than individually falls into two groups. The first includes Kātip 
Çelebi’s Tuhfetü’l-kibār fī Esfāri’l-Bihār (Select Gift in Voyages) of 
1729, Juda Tedeusz Krusiński’s Tārīh-i Seyyāh der Beyān-i Zuhūr-i 
Ağvāniyān ve Sebeb-i İndihām-i Binā-i Devlet-i Şāhān-i Safeviyān 
(History of Traveller about Afghans’ Appearance and Reasons for 
the Decline of the State of the Safavi Shahs) of 1729, Tārīhü’l-
Hindi’l-Garbī el-Müsemmā bi-Hadīs-i Nev (History of the West 
Indies Called the New World) and Nazmizade Efendi’s Tārīh-i 
Tīmūr-i Gurkān (History of Tamerlane), and Süheyli Efendi’s 
Tārīhü’l-Mısri’l-Cedīd: Tārīhü’l-Mısri’l-Kadīm (History of Contem-
porary Egypt: History of Ancient Egypt) of 1730. The second 
group includes Müteferrika’s own writings such as Usūlü’l-Hikem 
fī Nizāmi’l-Ümem (The Fundaments of Wisdom with regard to the 
Order of Nations, 1732) and Füyūzāt-ı Mıknātısiyye (Features of 
the Magnets, 1732), as well as Ömer Bosnavi’s Ahvāl-i Gazavāt der 
Diyār-i Bosna of 1741.  
Before turning to the numbers of unsold copies, two obser-
vations are worth making. First, 
there were obviously 
fewer 
unsold copies of earlier than later editions because they had been 
on the market for a longer period of time. Second, at the time of 
the inventory, some books seem not yet to have been ready for 
sale, as in the cases of Kitāb-ı Cihānnümā, Nacima’s Tārīh, and 
Raşid Efendi’s Tārīh and Ferheng-i Şucūrī. Most of these copies 
were unbound 
(cildsiz), unpolished 
(mühresiz) 
and without 
margins around 
the pages (cedvālsiz). The unsold copies of 
Gülşen-i Hulefā, Tuhfetü’l-kibār, Tārīh-i Seyyāh, Tārīhü’l-Hindi’l-
Garbī, Tārīh-i Tīmūr-i Gurkān, Tārīhü’l-Mısri’l-Cedīd; Tārīhü’l-

70 

"
81,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

Mısri’l-Kadīm and Takvīmü’t-Tevārīh were sewn (dikilmiş), cut 
(kesilmiş) and partly bound. The books of which there were very 
few unsold copies, such as Grammaire turque, Usūlü’l-Hikem fī 
Nizāmi’l-Ümem, Füyūzāt-ı Mıknātısiyye, and Ahvāl-i Gazavāt der 
Diyār-i Bosna, were properly bound (tamām mücelled). It seems 
that there was some connection between the demand for certain 
books and the success of their sale, on the one hand, and the state 
of their preparedness for sale on the other.  
By 
juxtaposing 
the numbers of unsold copies against 
the 
number of the initial print run of each of the Müteferrika editions, 
one is able to ascertain the degree of popularity that each title 
enjoyed. As shown 
in the table and 
figures presented 
in the 
appendix at the end of this chapter, where the number of copies 
left unsold is juxtaposed with the number of the initial print, 
among Müteferrika’s bestsellers were the Vankulu Arabic–Turkish 
dictionary (see Figure 3.1) and Grammaire turque (Figure 3.4), 
followed by some titles such as Usūlü’l-Hikem fī Nizāmi’l-Ümem, 
Füyūzāt-ı Mıknātısiyye and Ahvāl-i Gazavāt der Diyār-i Bosna 
(Figure 3.5), as well as Naсima’s Tārīh (Figure 3.8). There are five 
other titles in history and geography like Tuhfetü’l-kibār, Tārīh-i 
Seyyāh, Tārīhü’l-Hindi’l-Garbī, Tārīh-i Tīmūr-i Gurkān, Tārīhü’l-
Mısri’l-Cedīd: Tārīhü’l-Mısri’l-Kadīm (Figure 3.2), which seem also 
to have sold well but since they are inventoried in one group it is 
difficult to make a distinction between them.  
Books such as Gülşen-i Hulefā (Figure 3.3), Takvīmü’t-Tevārīh 
(Figure 3.7) and Kitāb-ı Cihānnümā (Figure 3.6) seem to have 
enjoyed moderate commercial success. Only Raşid Efendi’s Tārīh 
(Figure 3.9) and Ferheng-i Şucūrī (Figure 3.10), which had been 
on the market for a good six years before İbrahim Müteferrika’s 
death, sold fewer than half the print run. 
Having examined the number of unsold copies and the degree of 
popularity of the individual titles, let us now turn to total figures to 
get an overall picture of the success or otherwise of the Müteferrika 
press. There are different estimates – 12,000,26 12,500,27 12,70028 or 
13,200 copies29 
in 
total. These 
figures, however, seem 
to be 
overestimations. In my opinion, the safest way to reach a more 

71 

"
82,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

accurate estimate is to turn to the aforementioned list in Naсima’s 
Tārīh, which, as I mentioned earlier, gives the total initial print of 
12 Müteferrika press editions (Grammaire turque is missing). The 
figure for these 12 editions can be calculated at 7200.30 We know 
from the author of Grammaire turque, Holdermann, that the total 
print run of the grammar was 1000 copies.31 Thus, the cumulative 
figure of initial print runs, of which the number of copies is known 
(as opposed to estimated), is 8200. As for the books for which the 
initial print run is unknown, as I suggested earlier, an informed and 
conservative figure is 500 copies for each of the last three editions. 
If we add the estimated figure of 1500 to the figure calculated for 
those books for which the initial print number is known, the total 
number of copies of all the printed books would be 9700. However, 
if we take a less conservative estimate of 1000 instead of 500 for 
those 
in 
the unknown category, 
then 
the 
total print of all 
Müteferrika’s printed books would equal 11,200 copies. While a 
definitive answer is impossible, one may opt to settle on a median 
number between the conservative figure of 9700 and the liberal 
figure of 11,200 to suggest that the total number of printed copies 
was in the range of 10,000 to 11,000 printed copies. If we juxtapose 
this figure against the number of unsold copies that Müteferrika left 
upon his death, which is 2981 unsold copies, as mentioned in the 
probate inventory, we could infer that 69.3 per cent of his editions 
were sold.  
These figures clearly show that İbrahim Müteferrika’s printing 
enterprise was far from the fiasco presented in scholarly and 
literary sources. Indeed, as we shall see later, as a first attempt at 
printing, Müteferrika’s commercial enterprise was comparable 
with that of the early European printing presses. However, before 
we become euphoric about this newfound ‘success’, these figures 
need to be qualified and inserted in different contexts before we 
declare a final judgement. First, not all the printed books that 
were circulated in the market had actually been sold. Some of 
Müteferrika’s copies were presented as gifts by him or by the 
Ottoman court to different royal libraries in Europe – in Austria 
(1730),32 Russia (1731),33 Sweden (1735)34 and France (1741–

72 

"

42).35 Having said this, the number of such gifts could not have 
been high enough to warrant adjusting the sale figures we have 
suggested. 
It 
is 
insufficient 
to 
consider only 
the number of 
copies 
Müteferrika may have sold in his lifetime, for these figures must 
be related to the market in which they circulated – the book 
market. In view of any market, and the book market in particular, 
price 
is 
the singularly most 
important 
issue, and has great 
implications 
for 
the 
success or 
failure of 
any 
commercial 
enterprise. As Osman Ersoy showed, the first printed books were 
far more expensive than manuscripts and were beyond the reach 
of even high-level functionaries.36 This confirms de Saussure’s 
remark that Müteferrika was unable to sell books because of their 
exorbitant prices. This apparently led the first Ottoman printer to 
reduce the initial prices, sometimes even twice, as Holdermann 
(in 1730),37 Müteferrika himself (in 1733 and 1734)38 and Edvard 
Carleson (in 1735)39 pointed out. The probate inventories of the 
time confirm such discounts of Müteferrika’s printed books.40 It is 
worth noting that the prices of some of Müteferrika’s editions 
such as the Vankulu dictionary and Raşid Efendi’s Tārīh were 
discounted twice, but subsequently recovered in the late 1740s. 
Such 
discounts may 
have 
been 
a 
commercial 
ploy 
that 
Müteferrika implemented as a sort of ‘promotion offer’ to induce 
the sale of his books, which would later be priced at what had 
initially been set. Thus, the relatively high prices of Müteferrika’s 
printed books must have affected their sales negatively, which 
were evidently 
less promising 
than expected. We may safely 
conclude that Müteferrika’s enterprise was established at a high 
price 
for the printer himself. The commercial success of his 
business, while 
not 
disastrous, was 
also 
not 
staggeringly 
successful.  
Aside from quantity of sales, we need to address yet another 
issue in evaluating the success of the printing press, and that is 
the quantity of printed books relative to the reading public’s 
market. Osman Ersoy has opined that İbrahim Müteferrika could 
hardly have hoped for commercial success because the total print 

73 

"
84,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

runs of his editions were so insignificant – not even ‘a handful of 
sand thrown to the sea’ or ‘a teaspoon of water given to a sick man 
dying of thirst’.41 To treat this issue, one needs to consult the 
appropriate 
source 
documents 
and 
apply 
a 
reasonable 
methodology. Thus far, Turkish researchers of Ottoman printing 
history have been unreasonably critical. They point out that the 
total print runs of the first Ottoman printed books were much 
lower than those in western Europe during the first half of the 
eighteenth century. Such a synchronic comparison, so to speak, is 
not very reliable because we are confronted with two identical 
processes but at different stages of development. One should not 
forget 
that Müteferrika’s 
effort 
represented 
the 
very 
first 
introduction of the printing press in Ottoman society, while in 
other parts of Europe at that time print culture was already 
centuries old. In my opinion, an accurate comparison would be 
between the initial stages of European (fifteenth century) and 
Ottoman (eighteenth century) printing respectively. This would 
represent a diachronic comparison between two processes that 
developed 
in different ages and contexts but that are 
in fact 
similar enough 
to warrant comparison. 
In applying 
such a 
methodology, one could reach a more objective assessment of the 
real achievements and importance of the beginnings of Ottoman 
printing. 
In this respect, comparing the average print runs of Mütefer-
rika’s editions with those of European incunabula, one can see 
that they are identical. Early printing houses in Europe tended to 
print between 150 and 1500 copies of a book and a considerable 
number of presses failed after only one or two books.42 It is thus 
not only unfair but also incorrect to claim that Müteferrika’s print 
runs were too low. After all, the print run of a given book should 
relate to its number of potential buyers and readers.  
Some insights into the Ottoman Muslim reading public can be 
gained by exploring probate 
inventories that 
include titles of 
books, but this approach is problematic for several reasons. First, 
the documentary basis for such a study is selective because, under 
Islamic inheritance laws, the registers of deceased persons only 

74 

"
85,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

required 
inventories 
if 
the deceased person had 
left children 
under age, if there was a dispute over the inheritance, or if there 
were no heirs at all and the state treasury (beytülmāl) would thus 
sequestrate 
the property. Second, 
the 
inventories 
reflect 
the 
situation at the time of death, so it is difficult to ascertain whether 
the deceased had had more books before the time of his or her 
death. Some book owners may have sold, given, or donated some 
or all of their books. Third, the number of book owners found in 
the probate 
inventories does not cover the number of actual 
readers, for many potential readers may not have owned books, 
like the medrese students who usually made use of public waqf 
libraries. Fourth, not all the registers survive. Even though the 
number of preserved registers 
is quite considerable, 
it 
is not 
possible for a single researcher to undertake the huge project of 
consulting all the available material.43 
Given 
the many problems 
in 
the sources, 
the best 
that a 
researcher can do is to limit the scope of his or her study in terms 
of chronology, geographical span and items studied. Having this 
in mind, I sought to look for book owners in probate inventories 
at the time of the first Ottoman printing press, limiting the range 
to 
the probate 
inventories of 
Istanbul. 
I 
chose 
to 
consult 
inventories related to people who enjoyed askeri status and who 
had left at least four manuscripts or printed books among their 
possessions when they died. The reasons I chose this sample are 
as follows: first, since these individuals lived in Istanbul, where 
the press was established, they must have seen or heard of it; 
second, as individuals belonging to the askeri class they were the 
most likely to have been able to afford such relatively expensive 
books; and third, as individuals who possessed more than three 
books, they were probably more interested in books than those 
who owned fewer than three. In the askeriye collection of the 
Mufti Archives of Istanbul, I was able to track down roughly 335 
deceased persons with more than three books registered during 
the period between 1724–26 (1137–38) and 1747–48 (1160–61), 
namely from the years when Ottoman Turkish printing started to 
the years when its first stage came to an end. This figure does not, 

75 

"
86,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

of course, refer to the real number of persons of askeri status who 
were book owners because, as I pointed out 
in the previous 
paragraph, the inheritance registers do not include the inventories 
of all deceased persons. Another caveat regarding the sample at 
hand is that the book market was not limited to Istanbul, but 
given that it is the imperial capital city, one would still expect to 
have the largest concentration of the reading public. Having said 
this, the figure of 335 book owners with more than three books 
found in Istanbul probate inventories implies that as a whole, 
both in absolute and relative terms, the Ottoman reading public 
seems to have been more or less limited. De Saussure narrates that 
‘the literate Turks are not so many in numbers; they are not fond 
of reading and they do not enjoy reading.’44 Holdermann made 
the same observation in 1730.45 The print runs of even poetry 
collections, 
a 
favourite 
topic of urbane Ottomans, 
and 
the 
textbooks printed in the 1840s and 1850s by the order of Istanbul 
book sellers (sahhāf) were usually 1200 copies.46 It was rare for 
the print run of an edition to reach 2000 copies.47 In this respect, 
the allegation that Müteferrika’s ‘handful of sand thrown to the 
sea’ seems to be incorrect. Given how limited the Istanbul reading 
market was 
in 
the eighteenth century, and 
the rather small 
demand for books, even in the middle of the nineteenth century, 
Müteferrika’s output was not at all insufficient, but actually a bit 
on the ample side considering the potential of the Ottoman book 
market. 
Special attention should be paid to the social and professional 
profiles of the people who bought Müteferrika’s printed books. A 
cursory glance at the same Istanbul probate inventories in this 
regard is necessary. While I found Müteferrika editions in only 16 
probate inventories, it was immediately apparent that the first 
printed Ottoman books appeared in probate inventories very soon 
after they were printed. Thus, their high initial price seems not to 
have been a problem for many potential buyers, and the same 
seems to hold for probate inventories held in the provinces.48 It is 
remarkable that those who owned such printed and expensive 
books were not only Ottoman military and bureaucratic officials 

76 

"
87,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

but also religious functionaries. This is significant because it has 
been alleged 
that religious 
functionaries were 
the 
traditional 
opponents of the printing press.  
In 
view of 
the 
contemporary 
reading public’s 
taste 
and 
preferences, it is important to contextualize Müteferrika’s print 
production. The majority of the book owners I studied, which 
included 
five booksellers, possessed predominantly 
religious 
literature, mainly in Arabic, and samples of poetry in Persian, 
Arabic and Turkish. Among the religious books the most popular 
were, naturally, the Qur’ān, a small collection of the most popular 
Qur’ānic chapters (sura) entitled Encām-i Şerīf after 
the sura 
Encām (the Camel), the religious poem Muhammediye written by 
Yazıcıoğlu Mehmed 
in 
1444, 
a 
biography 
of 
the Prophet 
Muhammad 
in verse, as well as Mehmed Birgivi’s sixteenth-
century Vasiyetnāme, a book on religious dogma and practice. The 
latter two writings belonged to Ottoman Turkish authors and 
their popularity was due 
largely 
to 
the accessibility of 
the 
language in which they were written. In history and geography 
the most popular books pertained to Islamic history, especially 
the History of al-Tabari recounting the life of Muhammad and the 
emergence and development of 
the early Islamic state,49 and 
travelogues written by pilgrims to Mecca.50 Old Persian epics such 
as Şāhnāme and Hamzanāme were also among the favourites. 
Dictionaries, on 
the other hand, are seldom 
listed 
in 
these 
inventories, even in those of the five booksellers I came across. As 
for the constitution of the reading public, it was mainly men of 
religion (ulema), both scholars and students, administrative and 
military officials, and sometimes traders and craftsmen. In terms 
of gender, men considerably prevailed over women as readers. 
Given such a 
reading public and 
taste 
in books, 
İbrahim 
Müteferrika definitely filled a gap by printing dictionaries first. 
Vankulu’s Arabic–Turkish redaction of Sihāh became a bestseller. 
However, 
in his editing policy Müteferrika was much more 
inclined to print historical and geographical books: nine of the 
sixteen editions are related to history, two others (Tuhfet and 
History of West Indies) combine history and geography, while the 

77 

"
88,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

most eminent product of his printing house was Kātip Çelebi’s 
geographical work Mirror of World. Müteferrika, however, printed 
texts, which were not in line with the traditional religious or epic 
literature popular at the time. By printing Ottoman maritime 
history or the political history of Persia, the caliphate and the 
Ottoman empire, as well as geographical books, Müteferrika 
seems to have attempted to provide books that would be useful to 
those 
involved 
in government by offering historical works of 
didactic value. 
Indeed, as William Watson 
states, 
İbrahim’s 
printing philosophy seems to have been completely utilitarian.51 
On the other hand, it is noteworthy that except for one title 
(Calendar of Histories, 
in Persian) all 
the books Müteferrika 
printed were in Ottoman Turkish and thus more accessible to 
potential readers. These books could be read not only by Muslims 
but also by Turkish-speaking non-Muslims. 
In 
this way 
the 
printer practically exceeded the scope of the traditional Ottoman 
Muslim 
reading public. Moreover, by providing 
secular and 
utilitarian knowledge, he 
challenged 
the 
traditional Muslim 
concept of knowledge and learning, which placed the emphasis 
on religious matters.52 A. Ubucini claims that printing brought to 
the Ottomans new branches of learning that played a significant 
role in their progress.53 
Was 
the 
first Ottoman printing press a success or 
failure? 
İbrahim Müteferrika’s probate inventory shows no evidence that 
he had failed in his undertaking. While unsold copies of books he 
had printed constituted a large part of his assets, that is probably 
normal for a tradesman and enterprising person. 
By the end of his life İbrahim Müteferrika was able to sell about 
70 per cent of the books he printed: quite a sufficient reward for 
his enterprise. Indeed, he seems to have been luckier than Johann 
Gutenberg, who lost his printing house through a debt to his 
sponsor Johann Fust. As Sigfrid Steinberg remarked, most early 
European printers 
seem 
to have been better printers 
than 
businessmen. They had limited commercial success because they 
were unaware of one important feature of printing: it requires 
significant advance investment and the turnover is necessarily 

78 

"
89,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

slow.54 In fact, de Saussure seems to have been aware of these 
requirements in that he expressed concern that the Müteferrika 
enterprise might cease with the printer’s death because of the 
Turks’ impatience with and lack of enthusiasm for delayed long-
term returns.55 
Sigfrid Steinberg’s remark raises the question of if we accept 
that the 
first Ottoman Turkish printing enterprise was not a 
commercial failure, why did it cease production immediately after 
Müteferrika’s death to revive sporadically just for one edition in 
the mid-1750s and then only in 1784 to continue along a more 
stable path? Is previous scholarship incorrect in claiming that the 
first Ottoman Turkish printing press was a failure rather than a 
success? 
Perhaps, 
the 
hitherto 
negative 
assessments 
of 
Müteferrika’s printing press come from an impression that the 
invention of printing in the West was a sweeping revolution that 
took place 
in a short period of 
time. 
In her 
famous book, 
Elizabeth Eisenstein put forward the idea that the printing press 
was an 
‘agent of change’ 
that resulted 
in a 
‘communications 
revolution’ in which the print culture replaced the traditional 
scribal culture.56 In response to criticism, Eisenstein explains her 
use of the term ‘revolution’. Her particular notion of revolution is 
inspired by Raymond Williams’s oxymoronic expression 
‘long 
revolution’57 in the sense that it is not about a fast change due to a 
single act, but a continuous, irreversible process, the effects of 
which 
gradually 
become 
visible 
in 
the 
course 
of 
its 
development.58 Not 
everyone, 
however, 
shares 
Eisenstein’s 
‘revolution’ theory. Robert A. Houston, for example, agrees with 
Eisenstein that printing undoubtedly changed ways of thinking 
and played an 
indirect role 
in economic, social and political 
development 
in 
early modern Europe 
(1500–1800), but he 
qualifies Eisenstein’s thesis by stating that the 
impact of the 
printing press ‘was neither immediate, nor direct, nor certain’. 
The 
changes were 
slow 
and 
contingent on 
various 
social, 
economic and political contexts, and the printing ‘was arguably 
not fully developed until the eighteenth century’.59 Jacque le Goff 
also stresses that, upon its introduction in Europe, the printing 

79 

"
90,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

press met the needs of only the literate elite, and it was not until 
the counter-reformation that this technology was used to educate 
the public.60 Finally, Brian Richardson 
concludes 
that 
‘the 
transition from manuscript to printed book was in some respects, 
then, a process of evolution.’61 Indeed, some recent scholars in 
book history have been 
re-evaluating Eisenstein’s 
theory 
in 
radical62 and moderate ways.63 Some criticize her non-contextual 
approach by positing that print culture existed side by side or 
competed with manuscript culture well 
into 
the eighteenth 
century. 
With respect to printing in the Islamic world, most scholars are 
inclined to think that the same ‘print revolution’ should have 
happened.64 However, there are a few who think that the printing 
press gave rise to a cultural ‘evolution’ in the Ottoman empire and 
Islamic world 
in 
general.65 
So, was Müteferrika’s 
printing 
enterprise an ‘agent of change’? Earlier scholarship answered this 
question by referring to the supposed commercial failure of his 
enterprise, which was suspended after his death. But, 
in my 
opinion, İbrahim Müteferrika was an ‘agent of change’, though 
not an ‘agent of immediate change’. 
Indeed, the transition from scribal to print culture was a slow, 
gradual and arduous process. In Brian Richardson’s words, old 
habits die hard.66 But at what stage in the development of printing 
could one speak of a ‘print culture’? This leads us to the question 
of how to define a print culture. So-called traditional 
‘print-
culture scholarship’ considers printing technology with movable 
type to be the beginning of print culture. However, for a print 
culture to dominate a scribal culture there needs to exist a social 
conviction in the necessity of printed ‘agents’ of knowledge and 
information. Thus, 
the establishment of a printing house 
is 
certainly a starting point in the formation of a print culture, but 
the spread of a print culture is contingent on the particular social 
context.  
It seems that the cursive nature of the Arabic script, which was 
in general use in the Islamic world, was not particularly suited to, 
and subsequently 
led to a reluctance to adopt, printing with 

80 

"
91,"THE FIRST OTTOMAN TURKISH PRINTING ENTERPRISE 

movable type. It was through the personal strife and effort of 
people 
like Müteferrika, and not socio-cultural demand 
that 
Muslim printing came into being. In fact, unlike many other 
innovations of European origin, such as cannons and firearms, 
the Ottomans did not apparently really need the printing press. 
However, once introduced, it attracted attention and left traces in 
Ottoman cultural history.  
İbrahim Müteferrika’s printing enterprise became possible 
because he was a confident bearer of the already developed 
European print culture and was probably well skilled in its arts. 
He was eager enough to undertake such an enterprise in an 
Ottoman milieu where calligraphy was esteemed and printing 
considered inappropriate for the Arabic alphabet. In a letter of 
1737, de Laria, an interpreter at the French embassy in Istanbul, 
provides a noteworthy detail about İbrahim Müteferrika’s habits. 
According to him, although İbrahim was a Hungarian convert to 
Islam, he was not particularly observant. In the light of such 
accounts, one could assume that İbrahim was in fact a good 
example of a cultural dichotomy or symbiosis. In other words, 
he never 
forgot his Christian past and never became a real 
Muslim – he could never negate his background, which was 
familiar with 
the print culture, and could never become a 
‘traditional’ Muslim for whom manuscripts were pretty enough. 
This explains why he was a quite adventurous ‘agent of change’. 
He succeeded in establishing a new enterprise and in putting in 
place 
the beginning of a 
long-term process of 
forming an 
Ottoman print culture. 
But when was Ottoman print culture 
formed? 
Jale Baysal 
suggests that an important step was made in 1803 when for the 
first time a religious book, Birgivi’s Vasiyetnāme, was printed in 
Istanbul and thus the Muslim reading public could get access to 
this rather popular text 
in printed 
form.67 According to her, 
during the period from 1869 to 1875, when the first Ottoman 
Turkish novels and plays were being written and printed, printing 
could adequately meet the expectations and tastes of the Muslim 
reading public and hence ‘was already accepted by the society’.68 

81 

"
92,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

During 
that period, however, 
another major 
step made 
it 
irreversible – the printing of the Qur’ān, first lithographically in 
1871 and then with movable types in 1874.69 Apparently, only in 
the 1870s did Muslim society get ready to have its holy text in 
printed form, having waited a long enough time to be persuaded 
by the advantages of printing technology. The probate inventory 
of a certain Hadice, daughter of Hacı Ömer Ağa from Salonica, 
dated 1878 and including two printed Qur’āns,70 suggests that 
printing was still not 
fully accepted as 
late as 1844 when, 
according to Charles White, Istanbul booksellers saw manuscript 
copyists as deserving to go to paradise and the printing press as 
made of the poisonous oleander (zakkum) plant.71 
It seems that the 1870s were indeed a turning point in the 
development of Ottoman print culture. Intellectuals like Münif 
Pasha (1830–1910) and Celal Nuri were concerned that printing 
with movable type did not meet the specificities of the Arabic 
cursive 
script.72 But 
this did not deter 
the Ottomans 
from 
experimenting with printing with movable 
type. Quite 
the 
contrary, 
in 1879 
the Council of Public Education (Meclis-i 
Macarif-i Umumiye) appointed a special committee to revise the 
Arabic script in order to make it incursive precisely for printing 
purposes, but the committee was unsuccessful.73 Later, however, 
in 1914 the so-called ‘Enver Pasha’s orthography’ (Enver Pāşā 
imlāsı), divided Arabic characters 
(in other words, made 
it 
incursive) and tested it in printing.74 Of course, what marked the 
end of all these problems was the 
introduction of a Turkish 
version of the Latin script in 1928. 
So, by the 1870s the Ottomans seem to have become accus-
tomed to having their books printed and the problem of the 
cursive Arabic script solved. If İbrahim Müteferrika could have 
seen these later developments he would have been very satisfied. 
Though we can never be certain if he died a happy or a desperate 
man, as in Jale Baysal’s play, Nevres’s consoling words are at least 
full of historical optimism. ‘Probably the next [generations] will 
read [your printed books] … as well as the generations after 
them. Did you not pave the way?’75

Nahils, Circumcision Rituals 
and the Theatre State 

Babak Rahimi 

In his seminal study of the Ottoman state, Formation of 
the 
Modern State, Rifacat cAli Abou-El-Haj identifies the seventeenth 
century as a period of intense and dramatic socio-economic and 
political changes in Ottoman society and its state apparatus. What 
constituted 
this critical 
juncture 
in 
such deep-seated 
socio-
political transformation, he argues, is the possession of semi-
private lands by the wealthy families and high-ranking officials 
previously controlled by the Ottoman state. Beginning 
in the 
seventeenth and continuing well 
into the eighteenth century, 
changes 
in 
state 
taxation 
led 
to 
the development of 
semi-
autonomous provincial ruling classes, which collected taxes on 
behalf of 
the central state and, consequently, steadily gained 
power in the provincial regions of the empire. State power was 
decentralized as 
large 
tracts of 
land, 
in 
the 
form of private 
property (mülk), were distributed among provincial officials in 
regions 
in 
the 
empire, 
creating 
‘semi-autonomous 
local 
dynasties’.1 
More importantly, in Formation of the Modern State, Abou-El-
Haj shows how the major social and economic upheavals that 
brought such far-reaching changes 
in Ottoman society 
in the 
seventeenth 
century were 
in 
fact 
symptoms of 
internal or 
indigenous processes.2 Because the centralized Ottoman state that 
emerged 
in 
the 
fifteenth century under Sultan Mehmed 
the 
Conqueror derived most of its income from caption tax paid by 

90 

 
"
101,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

the peasant population (reaya) of the empire, there were almost 
continuous uprisings by Ottoman subjects in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. These internal displays of resistance to the 
state’s form of revenue extraction, which at times resulted in 
waves of uprisings, marked crucial changes in relations between 
the state and society, particularly the state’s privatization of public 
property, which changed the reaya’s relationship to the land.3 
Ariel Salzmann’s 
study of 
the eighteenth-century Ottoman 
political economy substantiates the above observation by showing 
how, as a result of various privatizing fiscal policies and decen-
tralization processes, 
the Ottoman 
state underwent a major 
structural 
transformation 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century. While 
various patterns of administrative devolution of power were 
evident prior 
to 
the eighteenth century, 
the 
long-term 
insti-
tutional decentralization of the early modern Ottoman state, in 
complex social and economic relational settings between a centre 
and its many peripheries, led to provincial power building and 
reasserted the state’s central significance as the distributor of 
rights and official duties.  
For 
the most part, an 
increasing 
tendency 
to accumulate 
revenues through dispersed holdings in the private sector char-
acterized the eighteenth-century Ottoman state. The expanding 
power of 
the upper 
strata of 
the Ottoman gentry and 
the 
privatization or ‘Malikānization’ of state capital for new entre-
preneurial ventures further accentuated the decreasing authority 
of the state. This marked the emergence of new state–society 
relations that underlined the general ‘expansion of all sectors of 
the Ottoman economy during 
the 
first 
three-quarters of 
the 
eighteenth century’.4 
Abou-El-Haj 
and 
Salzmann 
invite us 
to 
reconsider 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
as 
an 
era of dramatic 
changes 
in 
the 
economic and political life of Ottoman society. They show us 
how the transformation of the Ottoman elite, accompanied by a 
greater display of 
intra-elite political struggle and increasing 
decentralization of authority, can be seen as ‘a change in social 
formation’. If approached in a comparable and commensurable 

91 

"
102,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

manner, this would also highlight the features that other ‘early 
modern’ (mainly European) state-building processes have 
in 
common. In this sense, the transformation of the Ottoman state 
in 
the seventeenth century should be recognized as having 
emanated from changes in the Ottoman societal structure that 
were similar to those that occurred in Western Europe. 
In similar vein, the present historical anthropological study 
can be seen as an invitation to look at the Ottoman state as part 
of an ongoing process extending from the early modern political 
transformation to the eighteenth century. My argument here is 
that, along with a series of socio-economic transformations, a 
peculiar set of socio-cultural changes occurred that marked a 
critical moment 
in 
the political 
transformation of 
relations 
between the Ottoman state and society. This transformation will 
be demonstrated in the cultural sphere of ritual performance, 
particularly 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
political 
rituals 
surrounding 
imperial 
circumcision 
festivals 
from 
the 
late 
sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries.  
These celebrations are crucial because they show the ritual 
ways in which changes in the enactment and representation of 
power occurred at the symbolic level during the so-called ‘Tulip 
Age’ (1718–30). Focusing on 
the ritual object of nahil, 
the 
wooden poles displayed during public and court festivals when a 
prince was circumcised, the circumcision celebrations of 1720 
served as an important cultural event in the spectacular ‘theatre 
state’ of Ahmed III’s Ottoman regime.5 The early eighteenth 
century version of the nahil identifies the formation of a type of 
ritual that represents and embodies state power as erect, incon-
sumable and solid, in other words permanent and absolute. In a 
sense, the presence of the symbolic association of fertility and 
consumption in the ritual object of the nahil, apparent in the 
1582 circumcision rituals, is replaced with the growing pomp of 
state power versus societal forces, namely guild associations, in 
the 1720 ceremonies.  
What follows is divided into three sections. In the first I focus 
on the historical formation of Ottoman circumcision rituals and 

92 

"
103,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

the evolution of nahil as a 
ritual object of great 
symbolic 
significance. In the second, in which the concern is more concep-
tual, 
I offer 
an 
interpretative 
examination of 
the political 
relevance of the nahil 
in the ritual body of the circumcision 
ceremonies. This will be done by considering how such a fertility 
symbol, 
in 
its close association with 
the body of 
the male 
sovereign, provides various dramatic spectacles 
in 
the repre-
sentation of state power. Finally, in an attempt to emphasize 
common 
features 
in the cultural reproduction of state power 
manifested in ritual processes across regions and histories, I shall 
present a brief comparative 
theoretical study of 
the 
imperial 
ceremonies with the Safavid Muharram rituals.  

The Ottoman theatre state and imperial circumcision 
rituals 

By ‘theatre state’ I refer specifically to a set of invented or recon-
structed ceremonies aimed at enacting and representing power 
through ritual performance. Such political rituals tend not only to 
represent power in dramatic ways, but also to conceal tensions of 
authority and political power, in particular by displaying more 
harmony than may actually exist in a particular society. In the 
words of Clifford Geertz, based on his observation of Balinese 
rites of power, 
‘the dramas of 
the 
theatre state, mimetic of 
themselves, were, in the end, neither illusions nor lies, neither 
sleight of hand nor make-believe. They were what there was.’6  
In other words, ritual enactments of symbols do not imitate 
social reality as much as they reproduce themselves, their sym-
bolic 
features, 
in 
the ritual process of spectacles and 
in 
the 
dramatic display of 
images 
for the sake of power 
itself. The 
theatre state involves the repeated enactment of symbols, myths 
and allegories that evoke imageries of a permanent state in lineage 
with an eternal past and continuous future, as something that 
transcends the lives of the individuals who participate in the 
ceremony and are members of an immortal entity.  
In early modern European history, the phenomenon of theatre 
state formation was mainly accompanied by patterns of statism 

93 

"
104,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

that saw the emergence of more territorially defined and militarily 
monopolized processes 
in 
the 
consolidation of monarchical 
authority. New developments in military technology changed not 
only patterns for preparing and engaging in war but also the ways 
states were governed. The rise of ‘absolutist states’ in western 
Europe marked the proliferation of organized military institutions 
that reflected a gradual increase in the integration of territorial 
boundaries (territorialization), tied in simultaneously with the 
expansion in the monopoly of organized violence.7  
In 
the 
first place, war and preparing 
for war 
involved 
the 
advancement of large armies and military technologies for domin-
ation in the interstices of competing empire-states.8 At the second 
level, the deployment of military coercion followed the centraliz-
ation of royal authority as the masculinization of monarchical 
courts from semi-feudalistic towards more territorially bounded 
states advanced the absolutist conception of royal sovereignty.  
Between the late fifteenth and eighteenth century, the Otto-
man state shared with political states elsewhere in Europe (most 
notably 
in western regions 
like France, England and Spain) 
similar 
features of territorial statism. These 
included 
further 
territorial assimilation, increases in taxation, a rise in military 
spending, superior military forces and greater regularization of 
institutions and official administrations. But one feature these 
states also shared with the Ottomans was the need to devise 
cultural strategies for constructing collective identities with a 
view to building and stabilizing individuals capable of inter-
acting with each other in a productive manner, thus creating 
territorially bounded and stable communities under the hege-
mony of the state. An increase in the number of festivals and the 
introduction of 
elaborate political 
ceremonies 
in 
the early 
modern period marked an integral feature of the new territorial 
states in bolstering claims to authority and evoking a cohesive 
imagery of state power in the minds of the individuals partici-
pating in spectacular festivities.  
These rituals, in a sense, also produced the knowledge of a 
total order to which all levels of the social stratum belonged, 

94 

"
105,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

though to different degrees and separately from other political 
orders. State power was affirmed through the production of 
images and symbolic enactments of authority 
that 
involved 
experiences of submission of self and other participants to a 
transcendental authority present here and now on earth.  
The Palm Sunday processions at the Kremlin during the reign 
of 
Ivan 
the Terrible 
in 
the mid-sixteenth century and 
the 
coronation of 
the young Louis XIV 
in 
the mid-seventeenth 
century (1654), with their peculiar display of both popular 
carnivalesque 
and 
courtly processions, 
serve 
as 
interesting 
examples of theatre states. These public spectacles produced a 
set of visual and iconographic emotions that aimed to generate 
vivid mental pictorial images and emotive symbols drawn from 
the repertoire of religious or political schemata. They fostered 
feelings of collective 
incorporation and 
solidarity 
in which 
individuals imagined and experienced the presence of a trans-
cendent community of shared emotions and ideals.  
Viewed in this comparative sense, the Ottoman circumcision 
celebrations also serve as an intriguing example in the develop-
ment of an early modern theatre state. Similar to other European 
state processions, like the Elizabethan royal ceremonies of the 
early seventeenth century in which medieval customs of kingship 
allowed royalty to travel around the kingdom and enjoy 
‘the 
hospitality of their subjects, moving from one castle to another 
and making their power known across the land’, the Ottoman 
circumcision rituals provided a mobile public stage on which, 
with the circumcision of a young prince as the future sultan, the 
sacred body of the sultan became a symbolic object of cele-
bration.9 
Accompanied by days of festivity and celebration – ranging 
from ten days in 1365 and 1530–1539, to 15 days in 1675 and 
1720, and even at times to 55 days in 1582 – the imperial 
circumcision feasts (bayram) marked an honourable occasion 
during which royal princes, along with hundreds of the sultan’s 
subjects’ boys, were blessed by the ceremony of circumcision. 
These events, which a festival chief (sur emini) would supervise, 

95 

"
106,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

included ceremonial receptions, a variety of communal feasts, 
athletic games, impersonations of mock battles on castles, fire-
works displays, or water features like illuminated models being 
sailed down 
the Golden Horn. The participation of 
foreign 
performers from Egypt and Persia and various displays of exotic 
animals like elephants and giraffes gave the ceremonies a more 
cosmopolitan flavour.10 
Along with the illumination of the capital city, Istanbul, with 
torches and lamps (known as donanma), the circumcision feasts 
included the decoration of public buildings, like the Topkapi 
Palace, Hippodrome and Yali Köşk; banquets for various foreign 
and state dignitaries; and public displays of animal sacrifices in 
the course of rich and spectacular pageantries. Interesting features 
of these dramatic ceremonies also included a circus and musical 
performances, along with displays of tableaux vivants in the shape 
of dragons and carriages exhibited on the Bosporus. 
While many court ceremonies (especially the actual circum-
cision of the royal prince) took place within the walls of the 
sultan’s palaces at Istanbul (1582) and Edirne (1674), the whole 
capital city and (at times) the provincial towns as well were 
involved in the large display of artisans and guild pageantry, 
which proceeded in an hierarchical processional pattern begin-
ning with the farmers and ending with the tavern associates.11 
Many guilds created tableaux vivants and elaborate devices, like 
a glass furnace surrounded by working glass blowers.12 Other 
guild members displayed goods produced by artisans, which 
were later sent for consumption to the palace or army. Walking 
alongside 
the guilds, 
some non-guild groups, 
such as 
the 
dervishes and various Sufi sects, along with the Greek com-
munities, joined the guild processions, highlighting the ethnic-
religious urban feature of these ceremonies.13 
Drawn on carts or carried through the streets on the artisans’ 
shoulders, the guilds exhibited their technical skills by dis-
playing pieces of work or usable goods on a moving stage.14 In 
some guild pageants, 
there were also processions of 
state 
officials, which included shaykhs and the supreme commander 

96 

"

of the Janissaries (ağa) depicting, in Suraiya Faroqhi’s words, 
‘Ottoman society in general, orchestrated by the sultan’s official’, 
watching the proceedings from a grand pavilion.15 For the most 
part, the participation of guilds underlined the urban social 
dimension of the Ottoman circumcision rituals, which provided 
an opportunity for all members of Ottoman society to participate 
in an official event sponsored by the imperial court, ‘so that even 
the poorest of the workers could have a sense of belonging and 
recognition’.16 

From stage to street: the transformation of a political ritual from 
1582 to 1720 
As described in various manuscripts or festival books (Surnameh) 
illustrating the accounts of the circumcision ceremonies, most 
notably the Surnameh of Lokman (1582) and Vehbi (1720) pre-
served 
in 
the Topkapi Palace Museum, circumcision 
rituals 
underwent significant change from the late sixteenth to the early 
eighteenth centuries.17 By and large, a significant shift of symbolic 
and performative focus occurred in the course of the ceremonies 
with their appearance as a full-blown dramatic stage-based spec-
tacle in 1582 to a more street-level carnivalesque processions in 
1720.  

The 1582 festivals  
The ceremonies celebrated in the capital city, Istanbul, for the 
circumcision of Prince Mehmed in 1582 consisted of various 
festivals and parades before the sultan, who watched them from 
an elevated pavilion. The surname describing the events men-
tions elaborate paraphernalia with the enhancement of realistic, 
fanciful and at times comical representations of foreign enemies 
(mainly Safavid Persians), along with a skirmish between the 
Janissaries and cavalry of the Porte.18  
A series of dramatic spectacles performed 
in unprecedented 
ways, with the apparent aim of enhancing the power and prestige 
of 
the Ottoman state, particularly since 
the 1530 and 1539 
circumcision processions, was central 
to 
these ceremonies. A 

97 

"
108,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

significant development in the celebrations under Murad III was 
the provision of a ceremonial stage on which 
to mount 
the 
spectacles during the course of the rituals. That the 1582 fes-
tivities were held on a much larger scale than before was mainly a 
result of the territorial expansion of the Ottoman state. In these 
festivals, state pomp was structured to portray the expansion of 
Ottoman territorial power as a theatre state. The construction of 
the splendid model of the Süleymaniye mosque, for instance, 
which was for the first time put on display and carried through 
the streets of Istanbul, marks the increasing significance of images 
and symbols of grandeur that depict the greatness of the imperial 
power through models of buildings and public sites.19 
Correspondingly, the artisan parades and guild processions first 
appeared 
in 
the 1582 
imperial ceremonies. According 
to 
the 
account of a European traveller, artisans took part in the parades 
and various shows, mainly during the morning hours of the 
festivities.20 With more than 150 guilds or esnaf participating in 
the ceremonies, many of their spectacles were displayed in the 
week before the circumcision,21 with guild processions continuing 
for 22 days in the course of the ceremonies and attracting wide 
audiences. The sultan, especially, enjoyed the rivalry between 
different guilds as each association tried to make their procession 
more spectacular as they vied for greater public admiration.22 
The development of guild pageantry as an emerging feature of 
the festivals highlights the growing presence of Ottoman asso-
ciational networks in the increasingly spectacular nature of the 
festivities surrounding the state’s ritual ceremony. This increase 
in carnivalesque features, which Derin Terzioğlu identifies, sig-
nifies both an expansion of mid-sixteenth century state-building 
in Ottoman society and an accumulation of wealth by the urban 
guilds.23  
It is not surprising, therefore, that the carnivalesque feature of 
the rituals is most prominent in the guild processions. This is 
mainly because of the way the ceremonies apply certain features 
of an ‘upside down world’ in which official culture is defied 
through 
acts of misrule 
and grotesque performances. The 

98 

"
109,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

expansion of the spectacularity and carnivalesque features of the 
ceremonies demonstrated a greater potential for disarray or mis-
rule in the 1582 processions as elites and various urban sectors 
of Ottoman society competed and, at times, fought each other 
(like the cavalry–Janissary battles) to bolster their social status 
and claim greater authority in the ritual forum.  

The 1720 festivals 
The Ottoman theatre state that found its greatest display of power 
in the 1582 festivals saw a series of developments in its aesthetic 
splendour and elaborate paraphernalia in the late seventeenth and 
early eighteenth centuries.  
First, the 1720 festivals, in honour of Ahmed III’s three sons, 
demonstrate a remarkable continuation in the presence of the 
guild parades, reflecting the prominence of the guilds as auton-
omous institutions that acted between the artisans and the state in 
the early eighteenth century. The prominence of guildsmen in the 
processions is something that can also be detected in the 1675 
festivals at Edirne, during the circumcision and wedding cele-
brations held by Mehmed IV, as described by Evliya Çelebi. 
According 
to Çelebi, ceremonies 
in 
the 
second half of 
the 
seventeenth 
century were dominated by 
the guilds, 
though 
apparently the presence of male and female non-artisans increased 
as well in ways unprecedented in previous festivals.24  
The guild street processions for the 1720 festivals, which were 
led by gold 
embroiderers, blacksmiths, 
cloth weavers 
and 
makers of seraser, involved several centres because, unlike the 
1582 celebrations, there was no central staging space.25 Also, 
with the increase in processional ceremonies held in the streets, 
along with the gradual decline (though still a prominent feature 
of the ceremony) in the mounting of performances at major 
public sites like the Hippodrome, the 1720 festivals took place at 
numerous centres where spectators and performers gathered, 
intermingled and 
together enjoyed 
the 
festivities and com-
motion. As an offshoot of the guild parades, an 
increase 
in 
elaborate displays and images in the artisans’ ceremonies can be 

99 

"
110,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

detected in the 1720 ceremonies, which were barely visible in 
the 1582 ones. The 1720 display of a three-dimensional model 
of a bath by Istanbul artisans, 
for 
instance, testifies to this 
pattern of dramatic development 
in 
the 
rituals.26 The pro-
cessional display of gold turban ornaments, called sorguç, of 
jewelled ornaments 
representing 
the goldsmith guilds, and 
wagons roasting coffee beans in large ovens representing the 
merchants of the flea market, highlights the significant role of 
the spectacular and exotic in the ritual body of the imperial 
ceremonies.27 But such 
theatrical 
techniques also 
identify a 
significant development in the dramatic spectacular facet of the 
ceremonies, 
further 
highlighting 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
Ottoman theatre state as a result.  
In an important way, the appearance in the 1720 festivals of 
punishment spectacles suggests an increase in state anxiety over 
turmoil in the market and the intrusion of urban sectors in the 
organization of the ceremonies. In a direct challenge to the guilds, 
state punishment of artisans who violated market regulations was 
a frequent feature of the 1720 ceremonies, reflecting the emer-
gence of an increased threat to the state from the growing power 
of the empire’s urban sector, mostly represented by the guilds.28 
Also, the absence of guilds headed by religious elders or sheikhs 
in 
the 1720 
ceremonies, which was 
a 
common 
feature of 
fourteenth-century Anatolian urban organizations knows as akhis, 
signifies the putative link between the market and urban organiz-
ations, independent of religious affiliation and state control.29  

The nahil in the 1582 and 1720 festivals  
The nahil, 
the central ritual object of 
imperial circumcision 
ceremonies, is a large pyramid-shaped wooden pole laden either 
with real or artificial flowers or with edible objects like fruit or 
sweets. The nahil would be carried at the head of a procession 
that included a number of Janissaries who would eventually place 
it beside the yet to be circumcised prince. Nahil processions were 
usually performed alongside various consumption-related activi-
ties 
like 
the distribution of sweet pastries, sweet drinks and 

100 

"
111,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

sherbet, and at times a sacrificial animal would be brought along 
to be slaughtered on behalf of the circumcised prince and royal 
family. Making nahils required products like ‘paper, charcoal for 
heating and for the foundry furnace, flax, willow twigs, flower-
pots and wooden pails’.30 By and 
large, however, 
the main 
symbolic makeup of a nahil, in its representational form, included 
banners, decorative sets of colorful flowers, fruits and candles, 
which were lit at night.31 These decorative patterns were con-
sistent symbolic features of nahil ceremonies from the sixteenth to 
the eighteenth centuries, though its construction became more 
expensive in the later period.  
The name nahil is derived from the Arabic word for the date 
palm tree. In the commemorative ceremonies of Muharram, cele-
brated 
to mourn 
the martyrdom of 
the Prophet’s beloved 
grandson, Husayn, for instance, the nakhl (used here in its Arabic 
terminology) represents a symbolic coffin for the holy imam and 
his children martyred on the plain of Karbala. This symbolic 
artefact depicts the stature and courage of Husayn; it represents 
the sacred death of a male figure symbolically displaying his 
youth, as well as the way he fought and ultimately became a 
martyr for the cause of justice.32 
In Ottoman circumcision rituals, the nahil  symbolizes birth, the 
blossoming of life, fertility and regeneration. It is an Ottoman 
Turkic symbolic object used 
for weddings and circumcision 
ceremonies. With possible origins 
in central Asiatic animistic 
religious practices, which are absent in non-Turkic regions of the 
Islamic world – at least prior to the migration of the Turkish 
tribes to the Islamic world during the Middle Period – the nahil 
represents male strength or, as von Hammer-Purgstall describes 
it, ‘symbols of virile force and fecundity’.33 The cultural signifi-
cance of the nahil in Ottoman society cannot be overestimated. As 
a popular symbolic artefact, an entire Ottoman guild association 
specialized in making nahils, at times building them so large that 
it required hundreds of slaves to carry them.  
In 
its physical form, built with wax and wire, a nahil was 
covered with fresh flowers and sprouting foliage. Nahils were also 

101 

"
112,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

decorated with symbols of birds, plants and animals of various 
kinds, representing fertility and the renewal of natural virility 
embodied in a symbol of erect vitality.34 
In the historical development of circumcision ceremonies, the 
nahil remained in a stationary position, mostly within the palace 
walls. In the 1582 ceremony, when the size and number of 
nahils 
exceeded 
those 
of 
previous 
festivals, 
the 
pyramid 
constructions remained in the Old Palace, from where dockyard 
slaves and 80 Janissaries would later carry them outside for the 
prince’s procession.35 
In 
the 1720 
festivals, 
a nahil 
agasi 
arranged and set up the nahils at the Eski Saray (Old Palace) 
nine days before the ceremonies began.36 Along with the candy 
gardens, which were 
also 
an 
important 
feature 
of 
the 
ceremonies, the floral decorations at the Eski Saray appear to 
have been guarded by special guard units from the palace, as 
illustrated in Levni’s surname. In a symbolic sense, the four 
nahils, representing each of the four princes to be circumcised, 
remain erect and protected within the palace (the domain of 
purity and royal vitality) and away from the city (the realm of 
pollution and the ordinary populace).  
The nahils are 
later carried out of the palace and paraded 
through the city streets by the Tersane Corps, who carry them on 
portable platforms and parade to the tune of the musicians.37 Sur 
Emin Halil Efendi and the deputy commander of the Tersane 
Corps march in front of the nahil agasi.38 While the nahils are 
being carried through the streets and alleys, the carpenters who 
built the gigantic 
floats demolish any public sites that could 
obstruct 
the passage of 
the nahil carriers, as 
if ceremonially 
further emphasizing the absolute virility of these ritual objects 
representing the yet to be circumcised princes.39 Towards the end 
of the festivities, once the princes have been circumcised, the 
nahils are apparently brought back to the palace where they are 
returned to their stationary position at the sultanate domain.40 
An important change in the production and development of 
the nahil can be detected in the ensemble of consumable items 
used for decorating the ritual objects. In the 1582 festivals, the 

102 

"
113,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

nahil was made partly with coloured wax ornaments and partly 
with sugar. In 1720, this practice continued except that the 
sugar used to decorate the nahil was mixed with other decor-
ative objects, hence making it toxic and inedible. As Faroqhi 
explains, 
‘when one 
considers how 
expensive 
and 
rare 
a 
commodity sugar was until the nineteenth century, it becomes 
clear 
that 
these gardens 
represented conspicuous consump-
tion.’41 But this, however, remains highly unlikely because, as 
Faroqhi herself correctly notes, many of the substances used to 
colour the decorations were toxic, and hence non-edible.  
Unlike the pre-1582 festivals, during which the nahil was an 
object of ritual consumption insofar as the decoration and sugar 
used were edible and distributed to the crowd at the end of the 
procession, the eighteenth-century makeup of the nahil consisted 
of non-edible substances. In fact, in the eighteenth century the 
nahil pageantry became less sophisticated in its decorative appear-
ance and simpler in its spectacular features, for it was created 
mainly from gold and silver, which are clearly inedible. Here, 
there is a clear progression in the making of nahils from being 
ritual articles for ceremonial consumption to being processional 
theatrical objects to display for spectacular purposes.  
Why did this happen? What does the development of the nahil 
from an edible to a non-edible decorative object signify in the 
context of the change that took place in the imperial circum-
cision ceremonies? What political symbolic implications does it 
entail? And how does this transformation at the symbolic core of 
the circumcision ritual highlight changes in the Ottoman theatre 
state in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries?  

From blessing to solidarity: a symbolist interpretation 
of imperial circumcision rituals  

In Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas focuses on pollution in an 
intriguing 
analysis of 
food 
taboos.42 Religious 
symbols, 
she 
argues, provide a sense of identity, the production of a sense of 
communal solidarity. This is attained through enacting symbolic 
and performative activities that are related to concrete aspects of 

103 

"
114,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

collective demeanour 
in 
everyday 
life, 
constructing 
crucial 
boundary makers in determining who could belong to a particular 
communal group, while excluding others in the process. Among 
the most fundamental and significant of these is the communal 
act of consumption – the culture of the production, preparation 
and consumption of food.  
According to Douglas, the prohibition of food consumption is 
directly linked to spiritual pollution. This means that spiritual 
impurity cannot be understood detached 
from a 
system of 
symbols, ideas and values that are linked to social boundaries 
defining purity and identity. Purity, in this regard, can be defined 
as an attribute of something that can facilitate a perceived unitary, 
universal order of existence. Whatever disturbs that order of 
perceived coherence is at odds with it, and hence causes impurity 
best embodied in the form of ‘dirt’ (taboo); and whatever objects 
or creatures meet the stipulated requirements of their respective 
categories 
in the cosmos of order are 
identified as pure and 
spiritually clean.  
Combining features of central Asiatic (animistic and shaman-
istic) and Irano-Mesopotamian (Islamic) cultural practices, the 
Ottoman circumcision ceremonies highlight a fascinating case of 
production and reproduction of purity and blessing through the 
public display of the future sultan’s body, most notably his most 
sacred male entity, his phallus, symbolized 
in the 
form of a 
handsomely decorated wooden pole, the nahil. It can be argued, 
albeit in the absence of ethnographic evidence, that the Ottoman 
circumcision 
nahil 
ostensibly 
represents 
an 
uncircumcised 
phallus. As the processions begin at the Eski Saray, where the 
sweetened gardens are also placed, 
the nahils 
remain erect, 
beautifully ornamented with sugar and decorated with animals 
and plants representing the purity of the young prince and his 
reproductive power to renew life prior to his ritual circumcision.  
The first point I want to make is that in a number of ways the 
symbolism of the event occurring at the Old Palace marks an 
initial process in which the symbolized (uncircumcised) phallus 
of the prince, though potentially a source of power, still lacks 

104 

"
115,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

royal strength and virility; 
its power needs 
to be actualized 
through the sacred initiation rite of circumcision, in which the 
young, uncircumcised prince is transformed into a mature sultan. 
This perhaps explains why royal guards continue to protect the 
four nahils. The reason to protect the nahils is not because of any 
actual threat to the symbol of sultanate virility, since it is hard to 
imagine that the wooden poles at the royal palace would be under 
any danger from outside the court. It appears that such protection 
is provided mainly for symbolic purposes.  
The guards protect the nahils, the purist and vital part of the 
future sultan, as the prince awaits the inevitable act of circum-
cision. The protection of the nahil marks the eventual promise of 
victory of the supernatural strength of the ancestor sultanate body 
over the world of nature, symbolized by the consumption of 
natural products (sugar and the symbolic display of animals) 
decorating the nahil. What is more, there is a striking temporal 
connection between the presence of the physical domestic realm 
(royal palace), where the nahils are kept in the maternal domain 
of the valide sultan, the mother of the young prince, and the 
eventual expectation of an outward journey to an outer world 
(city spaces), as the wooden poles are paraded in the streets 
outside of the palace.  
As in 1582, the nahils are taken out of the palace nine days 
before the ceremony is due to begin. During this period, the ritual 
objects are sweetened for both eating and decorative purposes in 
preparation 
for 
the dynastic male 
figure’s 
journey 
from 
the 
domesticated court to the public civic sphere. The initial ritual 
processions involve a series of ceremonial preparations for taking 
the young prince away from the world of women and introducing 
him to the outer world of the public, where, after the royal 
surgeon 
or 
jerah 
has 
performed 
the 
violent 
operation 
of 
circumcision, he will have to share the strength of the sacred 
royal domain with others. In many ways the link between the 
royal palace and public domain seems crucial to the circumcision 
rituals because such a link would also enable the Ottoman public 
to participate in the act of removing the young prince from the 

105 

"
116,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

field of matrilineal vitality to masculine virility, and receiving his 
blessing for the first time.  
By and 
large, the Old Palace also 
identifies the domain of 
ancestral authority. The use of sugar for the nahil is not just to 
signify a festive event, as in the case of wedding ceremonies 
(another purity ritual), but to represent a type of performative 
ritual of purity that in a stationary position indicates the royal 
ancestral vitality of 
the Old Palace, where 
the spirits of 
the 
sultans, the paternal ancestors of the young prince, continue to 
dwell and maintain a boundary between themselves and the world 
of the outside populace. But it is with the mix of the future 
sultan’s purity and power, embodied in the nahil, that the public 
too expects to receive a blessing from the royal court, the sacred 
domain of the sultan and his ancestors. The festivities, in the form 
of the nahil processions, can be seen not merely as a masquerade 
performed with great shows of ecstasy, but also as a celebration of 
the ancestral blessing that the act of circumcision would bring to 
the community at large.  
Here, the symbolism of descent plays a crucial role in the cir-
cumcision procession. This is because descent is the display of the 
total social unit, a transcendental force that extends beyond the 
here and now. The nahil represents more than the symbolic union 
between the ancestors and the living young sultan, depicted in its 
stationary and erect form. The image of generational shift through 
the process of individual biological ageing undergoes an identical 
transfer of blessing 
for all descent-group members, 
including 
those living outside the royal palace. It is in this sense that the 
Old Palace, partly representative of personalized maternal virility, 
must be left in order for the prince to obtain maturity and royal 
strength. This must be done so as 
to ensure an 
important 
ancestral transition from the inside (domestic) to the outside 
(public) world, where an individual prince will mature and gain 
virility by becoming part of the depersonalized outside realm of 
the public. Inherent in the domestic domain is the ambiguous 
maternal–paternal guardianship as a source of ancestral authority 
over the yet to be circumcised prince.  

106 

"
117,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

The following description of an odd ritual in the course of the 
1582 circumcision celebration of Murad’s son Mehmed by Joseph 
von Hammer-Purgstall highlights the ambiguous ancestral nature 
of the Old Palace.  

The musicians of the sultana, widow of Sokolli, put on a 
kind of mythological pantomime; accompanied by 
the 
harmony of cymbals, lutes, and violins, a hired assassin 
approached a young child disguised as Cupid, and tried to 
seize him, at first using flattery, then force; but a young 
girl, armed with a javelin like a nymph of Diana or an 
Amazon, 
intervened 
at 
the moment, 
drove 
off 
the 
audacious aggressor, and saved the young child. 43 

This performative display, where a female protector defends and 
rescues a young boy from an immediate threat, underlines the 
authority of 
the young prince’s 
female guardians, who 
are 
acknowledged 
as 
significant 
carriers 
of 
ancestral 
authority, 
housed in the Old Palace, in the course of the ceremonies.44 This 
dramatic representation was sponsored by Ismihan Sultan, the 
prince’s aunt, and indicates that the female elders of the court 
play a 
special 
role 
in 
the orchestration of 
the 
festivals, as 
protectors of the dynasty’s heir as he enters public 
life. The 
maternal 
feature 
of 
the 
dynastic 
life 
is 
reassured when 
circumcision finally occurs and the young prince’s foreskin is 
carried to his mother on a gold plate.45 The foreskin symbolizes a 
new beginning in the prince’s life, as the maternal guardian or the 
valide sultan now receives a disjointed bodily part of the prince, 
representing the uninitiated life of the prince embodied in the 
spiritless 
foreskin – a prince who no 
longer 
lives under the 
protection of his mother.  
When 
the hypothesis of purity and danger, as defined by 
Douglas, is applied to imperial circumcision rituals, the nahil can 
be seen as a symbolic act of ancestral blessing. By this I mean that 
the ways in which this pyramid-like ritual object embodies the 
purity of the sultan’s body at its most basic and elementary – 

107 

"
118,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

sugary and sweet, a source of strength – binds the eternal soul of 
the sultan’s ancestral authority, shared by the prince’s mother and 
father, to the profane world of the public. Symbolically, it is the 
sultan’s 
essential male body part 
that 
the nahil 
represents, 
signifying his chivalric status as 
the male 
figurehead of 
the 
community.  
How ideology is produced through the circumcision festival has 
been illuminated by Victor Turner in his famous study of the 
ritual process, though Turner reaches a different set of con-
clusions 
from 
the 
interpretation 
I am applying 
to 
this case. 
According to Turner, a rite of passage can be seen as a movement 
or process from structure to anti-structure, and back once more to 
structure. The anti-structural or liminal, ‘betwixt-and-between’, 
identifies a middle stage in an initiation ritual that is indefinable 
and 
consists of 
aspects of both purity 
and profanity. The 
structural, when a ritual process begins, identifies the orderly 
though a yet 
to be actualized 
identity of an 
individual or 
community that undergoes a process of subjective transformation. 
The movement away from the liminal towards the structural, 
however, reassures the system of ranks, offices, organization and 
hierarchy used to order society in a more enhanced form. The 
final point of a ritual process, 
its end 
journey, 
then 
is 
the 
reaffirmation of a society’s power structure and of the ideals of a 
given community.46 
While a lack of ethnographic data and textual evidence make it 
impossible to deal with the sequence of the ceremonies in detail 
here, there are three aspects of these ceremonies on which I 
would like to comment briefly. First, as mentioned earlier, the 
nahil’s stationary position at the Old Palace can be recognized as a 
structural medium through which the phallus of the sultan, in its 
most purified, though untouched (uncircumcised) form, is set up 
and prepared (even protected) 
for 
the upcoming ceremonies. 
Second, the days of the ceremonies (both in the 1582 and 1720 
versions) include a nahil parade that lasted for an entire week. 
Much of this period can be seen as an act of blessing in that the 
participants in the ritual are celebrating the continuity of the 

108 

"
119,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

community in ceremonial ways that show the power of the future 
sultan, with the promise of virility in the shape of a phallic-like 
object, displayed and paraded in the festival grounds and streets 
of the capital city, where people celebrate and cherish its presence 
with carnival festivities.  
The third final stage, the super-structural phase, includes a 
period in which the nahils are returned to the palace from where 
the processions originally began. This is to suggest a moment of 
return, a homecoming to which a community blessed by the 
sultan’s virile power embodied in the nahil can now enjoy the 
presence of a yet 
to be circumcised prince and symbolically 
participate in the making of a new sultan. The consumption of the 
nahil, as it is paraded through the streets, serves to demonstrate 
how the sultan’s body in its most blessed and yet elementary form 
can be shared by the community and consumed (internalized) by 
other members of the community during the processions. This is 
also indicative of how sacred vitality can be transformed to other 
members of the community, to the royal subjects of the sultan 
and to the upper strata of the court, with the sultan’s body 
embodying elements of a permanent institutional structure upon 
which Ottoman society depends.  
This two-way process, an outer and 
inner movement, cul-
minates in a final violent event, the circumcision of the young 
prince within 
the native, domestic domain, governed 
and 
controlled by the prince’s mother, namely the royal palace (as 
evident in both the 1582 and 1720 cases). Though a pre-Islamic 
institution, throughout Islamic history circumcision rituals have 
been performed either to signify the purification of the young or 
as an initiation rite, a reception into a religious community of 
believers.47 Adulthood 
is attained by committing an act of 
violence on the body and, more importantly, the fertile and most 
‘private’ part, the foreskin of the phallus in the case of boys and 
genital mutilation in the case of girls.  
As Arnold van Gennep 
explained, 
features of 
fertility 
in 
circumcision rites underline the reason why the ceremonies show 
a striking similarity with bridal processions. The use of nahil for 

109 

"
120,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

both circumcision and bridal processions, as in the case of the 
1539 circumcision festivals, suggests strong symbolic reference to 
fertility and biological reproduction 
in the course of the two 
distinct types of initiation rites.48 For this reason circumcision 
was also a 
fertility ceremony 
for 
the Ottomans, an event of 
regeneration, in terms of a ‘wedding of the soul’, with overtones of 
rebirth of life and resurgence of vitality.49 
A striking feature of the ceremony, and indicative of the public 
significance of the performance, is that a number of ordinary 
(non-royal) boys are circumcised along with the young prince. 
This collective performance of circumcision highlights the union 
the sultan and his sons make with the (future) Ottoman society, 
personified in the common boys, a union that involves an initi-
ation ceremony or rite of passage towards creating a more unified 
collectivity and affirming communal solidarity. In these rituals, 
the political underlines a type of ritual process in which collective 
identity 
is constructed 
through 
the symbolic performance of 
collective violence (public circumcision).  
The most fascinating feature of the nahil symbolism is the use of 
animals and flowers to decorate the phallic object. The symbolic 
display of flowers and animals is indicative of the virility of the 
young prince, which through the performance of circumcision 
blossoms, so to speak, a new, strengthened form of vitality. The 
symbolism of such natural objects is crucial to the rituals, since it 
highlights 
the 
symbolic conquest of natural vitality 
for 
the 
strengthening of supernatural virility promised 
for the young 
prince and shared by the community.  
The significance of such symbolism can be recognized in a 1582 
official invitation letter to Ottoman dignitaries, poetically iden-
tifying the young prince as a ‘new plant’ and blossoming ‘flower’. 
Consider the following passage from the invitation:  

We have consequently resolved to accomplish the precept 
relative to the act of circumcision, the person of prince 
Mehmed our well beloved son; of this prince who, covered 
with the protective wings of celestial grace and divine 

110 

"
121,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

assistance, believes in felicity and in good grace, in the 
glorious path of the imperial throne … of this prince who 
is the most beautiful of the flowers of the garden of equity 
and of sovereign power; the most precious sprout of the 
garden of grandeur and majesty; the pearl of the most fine 
pearliness of monarchy and supreme felicity; finally the 
most luminous star of the firmament of serenity, calm, and 
of the public happiness. Thus the august personage of this 
prince, the plant of his existence, having already had some 
happy enlargements in the garden of virility and force, and 
the tender shrub of his essence making already a superb 
ornament in the vineyard of prosperity and grandeur, it is 
necessary that the vine-trimmer of circumcision work his 
sharp instrument on this new plant, on this charming rose 
bush, and that he direct it towards the vegetative knob 
which is the chief of the reproductive faculties, and the bud 
of precious fruits and fortunate sprouts in the great orchard 
of the Caliphate and of supreme power.50 

There are two salient ideas present in the above letter that 
deserve analysis. First and foremost, the metaphoric use of the 
terms ‘plant’, ‘rose bush’, ‘precious fruits and fortunate sprouts’ is 
clearly symbolic of the inherent purity of the young prince, which 
the act of circumcision aims to reinforce or further purify for the 
‘garden’ of the sultanate (ancestral authority), which is ‘already a 
superb ornament in the vineyard of prosperity and grandeur’. In 
other words, the young prince requires a ‘vine-trimmer’ so that 
his purity based on royal birth can be ensured as he matures and 
grows older. Second, 
the 
act of directing 
the 
circumcision 
‘towards the vegetative knob’ is meant to signify the regeneration 
of virility in gaining the ancestral fertility depicted in the ‘great 
orchard of the Caliphate’.  
Here blessing and reproduction remain 
inseparable. Accord-
ingly, the metaphoric use of natural objects is crucial to the way 
the ceremonies are described, since they highlight the symbolic 
embodiment of natural vitality for the expansion of ‘sovereign 

111 

"
122,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

power’ 
in 
terms of supernatural protection (‘celestial grace’) 
promised for the young prince, ensuring the extension of royal 
blood for generations to come. The symbolic ritual extension of 
royal virility remains central here.  
But this symbolic ritual feature appeared to undergo a dramatic 
transformation between the late sixteenth and the early eigh-
teenth centuries. As I indicted earlier, the nahils of the 1582 
ceremonies were most likely to have been made of edible objects, 
mainly sugar and fruits, which the greater population would have 
been able to consume. This, I suggested, brings to 
light the 
earliest formation of the Ottoman theatre state, in which the royal 
subjects can participate in the vitality of the sultan by consuming 
a personal part of his body, symbolized in the form of a wooden 
pole. The 1720 nahils, however, appear to be made of non-
consumable components. This, I argued, testifies to the expansion 
of the Ottoman theatre state into an impersonal repertoire of cere-
monial pageantry in which the sultan’s son and his symbolized 
body 
in the form of a nahil, had to be kept apart from the 
populace. Though paraded in the public streets, signifying the 
affirmation of power embodied in the yet to be circumcised prince 
and a future sultan, the 1720 nahils solidly remained a property of 
the palace, inedible and detached from the community, the urban 
domain.  
With the continuing presence of guild processions 
in early 
eighteenth-century pageants, it is most likely that the growing 
authority of Ottoman society also contributed 
to 
this 
ritual 
symbolic development. For the most part, the eighteenth-century 
version of the ceremony represents a political ritual that involves 
greater state pomp amid the presence of the guild parades, rep-
resenting communal authority in the course of a sultanate state 
ritual. What the nahil of the 1720 ceremonies identifies is the 
symbolized version of the sultan’s power, paraded alongside a 
powerful social sector of Ottoman society, the guild associations.  
With the transformation of the elaborated nahil into a more 
simplified gold and silver object, the imperial circumcision pro-
cessions 
reflect 
increased 
impersonalization of 
the Ottoman 

112 

"
123,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

theatre state, a ritual process that performatively dramatizes state 
power 
in 
distinction 
from 
societal 
performances 
of 
guild 
pageantry. To what extent the popularity of the royal circum-
cision rituals faded during the late eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries is not clear. They definitely lost the prominence they 
once had in earlier centuries. For the most part, though, one can 
claim that the eighteenth century saw significant changes in state 
and collective identity formation processes of Ottoman history in 
the ritual symbolic medium of the nahil, where power was both 
enacted and 
represented 
to affirm 
state authority and 
social 
solidarity.  

A comparative note on the Ottoman and Safavid theatre state 
As Abou-El-Haj correctly suggested, to overcome the notion that 
the Ottoman state and society were unique, it is crucial to engage 
in a comparative study with other histories. Although the rise of 
the early modern European absolutist monarchies maintain an 
important point of comparison, the development of the Safavid 
state, a neighbouring Muslim empire to the east of the Ottomans, 
in the seventeenth century deserves serious comparative analysis.  
Consider the Muharram rituals performed in commemoration 
of the martyrdom of Muhammad’s beloved grandson Husayn on 
the plains of Karbala in 680. These commemorative ceremonies, 
consisting of various ritual activities including self-mortification 
and lamentation processions, began to spread rapidly in Iran 
under the Safavids in the early sixteenth century. The declar-
ation by Shah Ismacil I (1501–24) of Imami Shicism as the state 
religion of Iran in 1501 put into effect a systematic attempt by 
the new regime 
to 
introduce what 
John R. Perry calls 
the 
‘territorialization of a state cult’.51 Built as 
it 
is around the 
symbols of martyrdom and a militant ethos of fortitude, the state 
patronage of the rituals introduced a new dimension of public 
procession, shabih, initiating radical transformations of the cere-
monies in the form of political performative events.52 Muharram 
ceremonies became increasingly sophisticated as a public rep-
resentation of political power towards the mid-sixteenth century 

113 

"
124,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

with the expansion of the Safavid state under the reign of Shah 
Tahmasb (1524–76). The ceremonies then became associated 
with the state, shaping the Safavid theatre state in the early 
seventeenth century.  
The most interesting development in the ceremonies is the state 
introduction of camel sacrifice rituals in the early seventeenth 
century. These rituals consisted of a ceremonial procession in 
which a camel was walked around the city for nine days, then 
taken to the outskirts of the city and slaughtered. The public 
procession takes place in the presence of the shah and his officials 
and with their direct involvement. The ceremonies end in the 
public display of ritual battles between urban religious guilds 
during which the winning team places the head of the camel in 
the ceremonial Tower of Skulls in the centre of Isfahan, where all 
the hunted heads of animals are kept, forming a high of tower of 
skulls.  
As I have argued elsewhere, these processions identify a three-
stage ritual: an allegorical hunting game, emerging from the realm 
of the sacred (city); then proceeding towards a violent assault 
against the purity of the shah lost in the camel and the pollution 
embodied in the animal; and finally ending with the slaughter and 
consumption as conquest over an imagined adversary (notably 
the Ottomans) in terms of expansion into aggression and war. On 
the two dimensions of spatial and temporal development, the 
sacrificial rituals reveal a significant political symbolism in which 
the participants regain a relinquished vitality in the performance 
of ritual consumption, a practice 
that ultimately affirms 
the 
immortality of the state as a transcendent entity.53 
But how can we compare the development of nahil in Ottoman 
circumcision rituals with the cultural practices of the Safavid state 
in camel sacrifice ceremonies? There is a fascinating common 
symbolic element in these two rituals. As in the case of Safavid 
Muharram camel 
rituals, 
the meat of 
the animal 
is 
ritually 
consumed by the guilds as an indication that the sacred vitality of 
the shah is distributed among (both male and female) members of 
the community. Ambiguously, the camel represents not only the 

114 

"
125,"NAHILS, CIRCUMCISION RITUALS AND THE THEATRE STATE 

shah (in the 
initial phase of the ritual process), but also an 
imagined adversary (in the second and final stage of the ritual 
process), notably the Uzbeks and Ottomans, in which the act of 
slaughter and consumption finally affirms a complete victory over 
the enemy. As in the case of Ottoman circumcision rituals, the 
nahil too represents royal (sultanate) authority in its purist form. 
The consumption of the nahil’s decorative sugar and fruit parts 
signifies how the sultan’s vitality is internalized by the (mostly 
male) members of the community. The nahil, like the camel, 
manifests royal sacredness 
in 
its most corporeal 
features: the 
phallus of the sultan (in the case of nahil); the bride of the shah 
(in the case of the camel as a sacrificial animal).  
Both ceremonies also indicate the ceremonial ways in which 
state power can be put on display through consumption rituals 
and fertility symbols. In a sense, it is interesting to note here that 
the camel, like the nahil, also represents a fertility symbol. The 
only difference though 
is that the female camel used for the 
Safavid Muharram ceremonies undergoes a process of pollution as 
it leaves the city (Isfahan), whereas the nahil ritual objects in 
Ottoman circumcision festivals not only retain their purity, but 
also increase their purifying and regenerative power once they are 
returned to the palace.  
The key issue here is the way ritual plays a central role in the 
production of Ottoman and Safavid theatre state from the late 
sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. Both states represent 
and enact power in diverse symbolic ritual mediums, as the royal 
authority grows increasingly powerful and detached from societal 
urban 
sectors. The 
transformation 
in 
the dramatization of 
symbols used in the Ottoman circumcision and Safavid Muharram 
rituals highlights 
the 
increasing 
theatrical aspect of 
the 
two 
territorial states in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 

Conclusion 
The above interpretation of the circumcision rituals is intended to 
show how Ottoman state power expanded in a complex set of 
cultural practices. The development of the nahil from the late 

115 

"
126,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

sixteenth 
to 
the 
early 
eighteenth 
centuries underlines 
this 
expansion in its apparent symbolic transformation from an edible 
to a non-edible ritual object. This, I argued, underlined changes 
in relations between the Ottoman state and society, in which an 
increase in the use of non-edible materials in making the nahil in 
the 1720 version of the ceremony signified a separation of the 
sultanate theatre state from Ottoman society, represented by the 
guild sector. The eighteenth century identifies the consolidation 
of the Ottoman theatre state in the dramatization of its symbolic 
repertoires in its inconsumable manifestation, through which the 
representation of power 
is enhanced 
in 
terms of a symbolic 
segregation of royal power from the urban populace in the course 
of the ceremonies.  
In broad 
theoretical 
terms, 
therefore, by 
focusing on 
the 
imperial circumcision ceremonies I have aimed to show how 
ritual drama and ceremonial performance can be seen as a major 
cultural site in the production (and reproduction) of state and 
society relations. At the historical level, I stressed how the study 
of early modern Ottoman state-building should also entail a study 
of 
ritual 
transformations, 
in which 
power 
is 
ultimately 
represented and enacted in complex symbolic ways. The early 
eighteenth-century 
circumcision 
rituals, 
therefore, 
serve 
to 
illustrate how the Ottoman theatre state experienced considerable 
transformation through the ritual expansion of state power amid 
the bustle of civic societal life.

Janissary Coffee Houses in Late 
Eighteenth-Century Istanbul 

Ali Çaksu 

Recently, serious attention has been paid to the institutions of the 
Ottoman coffee house and of the Janissaries, but to the best of my 
knowledge there is no separate study on Janissary coffee houses.1 
Given the importance of both institutions in Ottoman history – 
the Janissary in the military and political life of the empire, and 
the coffee shop in its public and cultural life – the Janissary coffee 
house is an important aspect of Ottoman history that is yet to be 
explored. It would be interesting to see how the institutions of the 
Janissary and the café, the former military and the latter primarily 
civic, came together, not 
in opposition, but to reinforce one 
another.  
This chapter constitutes a preliminary enquiry into Janissary 
use of the institution of the coffee shop and the multiple roles the 
café performed for this military group. I suggest that beyond the 
usual repertoire of activities that took place in civilian coffee 
shops, such as entertainment, gossip, political discussions, literary 
exchanges and concerts (all of which also took place in Janissary 
coffee shops), the Janissary coffee shop seems to have functioned 
as a site for other seemingly irreconcilable activities like policing, 
racketeering, Sufi rituals and even 
the provision of 
lodgings. 
Given 
that 
Janissaries ran a significant number of 
Istanbul’s 
numerous coffee shops, it is not enough to understand the role of 
the coffee shop without looking into its uses by the Janissaries, 
and it would be impossible to understand the Janissaries in the 

117 

 
"
128,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

late Ottoman period without 
exploring one of 
their most 
important haunts.2 While 
I do not claim 
that 
this study 
is 
definitive, I do hope that it will spark further research into this 
important topic. 
Before exploring the various functions of the Janissary coffee 
shop, I shall present a brief history of the Janissaries in the early 
modern period to show how this once elite military corps, famed 
for its formidable military skill, discipline and organization, came 
to be involved in such an earthly and mundane enterprise as the 
business of coffee shops. 
Despite their small numbers, for a long time the Janissaries 
formed the backbone of the Ottoman empire’s armed forces.3 
Their discipline, efficiency and unique contribution have left an 
indelible mark 
on 
both Ottoman 
and 
European 
history.4 
Generally of slave origin, most members of the Janissary had been 
recruited as children from the non-Muslim populations of the 
empire through what is called the devşirme system. They would 
be isolated from the urban civilian populace and given special 
training in the art of warfare and the precepts of the Islamic 
religion. They were 
the 
sultan’s 
elite 
troops 
and he was 
considered their head. Although in principle they were kept in 
relative isolation from the rest of the population, about 31 of the 
196 Janissary ortas (battalions) were assigned duties that brought 
them into contact with the urban populace of Istanbul through, 
for example, security, law and order or other municipal tasks in 
the city.5 Each orta would be assigned to one of the capital city’s 
districts and would operate out of a kolluk, which corresponded 
to a modern-day police station. Often, a Janissary café would be 
situated next to a kolluk, and sometimes an existing café would 
even double as a kolluk.6 Thus, even before the collapse of the 
devşirme system, which will be dealt with presently, the Janissary 
did have contact with the urban civilian population and, like 
them, used the coffee house as a primary site of sociability. 
When 
the devşirme system 
finally came 
to an end 
in 
the 
eighteenth century, 
the 
institution 
suffered a breakdown 
in 
discipline and vigour and began to lose its original elite status. 

118

Meanwhile, the worsening economic situation, which entailed a 
significant decrease in Janissary salaries, forced the previously 
self-sufficient soldiers to engage in income-generating activities 
that 
fell outside 
their military 
functions. At 
this point, 
the 
Janissaries were no longer subject to the original rules of the 
corps, such as celibacy and non-engagement 
in regular civic 
trades. Therefore, not only did Janissaries begin to get married 
and have families, for which they had to provide, but they also 
obtained permission to engage in several kinds of civilian services, 
trades and businesses, which rendered them eligible to join the 
urban 
esnaf, or 
guilds. However, 
this 
‘esnafization’ of 
the 
Janissaries was not a one-way process; it opened the door for the 
‘Janissarization’ of 
the esnaf, whereby members of 
the guilds 
started to acquire military status and the privileges that went with 
it.7 The increase in membership to the corps inflated the number 
of 
Janissaries 
to 
200,000, which was 
far 
too many 
to 
accommodate 
in the barracks. Consequently, many Janissaries 
took up lodging in bachelor rooms, inns, coffee houses and public 
baths.8 Not unexpectedly, it was roughly around this time that 
Janissaries became more heavily 
involved 
in the coffee house 
business.9 This new situation had a significant impact on the 
socio-economic life of the capital as well as on the Janissary corps. 
Not only did Janissaries become very involved in the social and 
cultural life of the city, but they also continued to meddle in the 
affairs of the state. 
Armed and generally discontented, Janissaries, as we shall see 
later in this chapter, were involved in several rebellions; they 
became a thorn in the side of the state and were seen as the most 
seditious element of the urban population. Some modern scholars 
have suggested that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 
the 
Janissaries’ 
political 
activities 
constituted 
a 
sort 
of 
counterbalance in favour of the people against the arbitrariness of 
state power, and that they became a formidable social force that 
provided 
a 
check 
against 
absolutism.10 This view was 
also 
expressed earlier, only a 
few decades after 
the state 
finally 
disassembled the corps: ‘It was the sight of thousands of Janissary 

119 

"
130,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

bodies rotting in the Golden Horn which have made our people 
unable to speak their mind since the Vakca-i Hayriyye [the event 
when the Janissary corps was dismantled], for the Janissaries 
provided a countervailing force to the oppression of officials.’11 
However, while the Janissaries reflected and represented the 
urban population’s concerns and complaints, they also felt no 
inhibitions about intimidating and bullying people if they felt so 
inclined. Through their engagement in all kinds of illegal and 
criminal activities, some of which we see 
treat 
later 
in 
this 
chapter, the population’s attitude towards the Janissaries was, at 
best, ambivalent. So, while the Janissaries mitigated state despot-
ism in favour of the people, their integration in, and acceptance 
by, the populace was never complete.12 
Given the relentlessness of the Janissaries’ political disturbances 
and 
intimidation of 
the population, 
the 
ruling elite became 
convinced that no amount of reform could transform the Janissary 
corps into an effective military defender of the empire in the 
modern world.13 Therefore, in 1826, in an event official Ottoman 
historiography terms the ‘auspicious incident’ (Vakca-i Hayriyye), 
the corps was finally and tragically dismantled.14 The Janissaries’ 
coffee shops, which as we shall see shortly functioned as the 
headquarters of Janissary political and criminal activities, shared 
the 
Janissary 
corps’ 
inauspicious 
fate 
at 
the hands of 
the 
‘auspicious incident’. 
Janissary coffee shops in Istanbul varied in size.15 Some were so 
luxurious 
and opulently 
furnished 
and decorated 
that 
they 
became the subject of poetic praise.16 They were generally estab-
lished in places that had the best views; many of them were built 
on the city walls overlooking the sea or on columns erected in the 
sea. Some of 
these 
coffee houses, which 
resembled palace 
divanhânes (reception rooms), were built by renowned architects 
of the time and furnished by master carpenters.17 For instance, we 
are informed that the Janissary coffee house at Çardak İskelesi 
(Çardak Wharf) was designed by an architect from the famous 
Ottoman Armenian Balyan family.18 Sometimes one orta might 
own a few cafés, or one Janissary officer might have more than 

120 

"
131,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

one coffee shop.19 What marked Janissary coffee houses was the 
insignia (nişân) of the orta, which would be placed above both the 
entrance to the coffee house and the hearth. Janissary coffee 
house customers were usually Janissaries of various ranks and 
their associates.20 According to some sources, non-Janissaries also 
visited these cafés and, in fact, the owner sometimes made them 
visit so that the latter’s income might increase.21 In some coffee 
houses, at least at the famous Çardak coffee house, visitors of 
various ethnic and religious origins frequented the place.22 
It is difficult to know exactly why the coffee house business was 
so popular with Janissaries, but I can venture a few suggestions. 
First, as a business, running a coffee house was not too demand-
ing; it required no particular skills, training or apprenticeship, so 
anyone with sufficient capital could open a café. Second, since 
coffee houses did not impinge on, or meet the objections of, 
businesses that were associated with well-organized guilds, the 
guilds allowed the coffee shop business to mushroom. Third, the 
café offered 
an 
appropriate place 
in which 
the orta 
spirit 
(regiment solidarity) could survive and flourish, which was of 
utmost importance to Janissaries in an environment outside their 
natural habitat – the barracks. Finally, and most importantly for 
this study, the café provided an adaptable place in which to house 
and absorb multiple activities. Beyond the ‘regular’ coffee shop 
activities usually associated with the cultural and social life of an 
urban civilian populace, like literary or musical exchanges and 
other forms of entertainment,23 the Janissary coffee shop also 
housed activities that fell within the Janissaries’ specific cultural 
requirements, such as the practice of Bektashism, and official 
duties like policing and market inspections. Furthermore, the 
coffee shop was also an ideal place in which to organize and carry 
out activities that ‘exceeded’ both ‘regular’ functions and official 
duties and 
that 
fell within 
the domain of 
the seditious, 
the 
intimidating and the unlawful. The following is an exposition of 
some of the functions of the Janissary coffee house as they are 
related to activities specific to the Janissaries.

Functions of the Janissary coffee house 

As a centre of rebellion and ‘sedition’ 
Perhaps the most important role of the coffee house in general, 
and the Janissary café in particular, was in the sphere of politics, 
which rendered them a target of the authorities. ‘Devlet sohbeti’, 
literally ‘state talk’, is the term used in the sources to refer to the 
political discussions that by and large took place in coffee houses. 
Such ‘talk’ disturbed officials who regarded it with suspicion and, 
due to its potential impact on the people, perceived it as a threat 
to 
the existing order.24 These political discussions 
included 
rumours ranging from the corruption of a certain pasha, changes 
in the cabinet to the possibility of war. In an age when illiteracy 
was rife, rumours were a very important means of communi-
cation, and they had a capacity to influence and orient public 
opinion, when the public was not supposed to have an opinion, 
about political matters. The authorities would habitually close 
down coffee shops, often using some non-political excuse. The 
famous court historian Nacîmâ’s complaints about the coffee shop 
are a good example of official disdain for such establishments. He 
states that coffee houses are places where people assembled to 
criticize men of rank and invent false rumours about state affairs, 
appointments and dismissals. Lest such gatherings lead to con-
spiracy, Murad IV patrolled 
the city day and night, keeping 
smokers and coffee drinkers under close scrutiny. His displeasure 
extended even to ordering coffee houses to be torn down.25 When 
coffee was 
first 
introduced 
in 
the sixteenth century, 
it was 
‘considered harmful for political reasons and fetvas were therefore 
issued against it’.26 In 1826 Mehmed Dâniş Bey made a similar 
complaint 
in his Netîcetü’l-Vekâyic. According 
to him, coffee 
houses (and 
incidentally barber shops) were places of 
‘false 
rumours’, ‘baseless talk’ and ‘various news regarding serious state 
affairs’ 
and 
therefore 
they 
often had 
to 
be 
closed down. 
Nevertheless, they invariably reopened and became so popular 
and widespread that in some districts their numbers began to 
exceed those of the houses and other shops.27 

122 

"
133,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

Although political discussions were not confined to Janissary 
establishments, Janissary coffee houses were particularly seditious 
and politically volatile places, simply because Janissaries pos-
sessed the means of coercion and could put words into action. As 
an armed urban force with a clear sense of group identity, the 
Janissary constituted a might to be reckoned with. Cemal Kafadar 
has demonstrated that the very existence of the Janissaries as a 
substantial physical 
force 
in 
the 
capital meant 
that parties 
struggling for political power would invariably try to form an 
alliance with them.28  
The 
insufficient salaries they received from the state was a 
particular source of resentment among Janissaries. Although some 
Janissaries found other means of earning an income, the salary of 
a senior Janissary ‘was not enough to take a bath in a public bath’ 
or rent a room, let alone provide a livelihood.29 Members of newly 
established units like Nizâm-ı Cedîd received high salaries, by 
contrast, which made the Janissaries look upon them with envy 
and resentment.30 This created an atmosphere of mutual distrust 
and hatred, and facilitated the circulation of ‘conspiracy theories’ 
by both the Janissaries and the elites, some of which were spun in 
coffee shops.31 Thus, dissatisfied and resentful of being replaced 
by new 
troops, 
the 
Janissaries were prone 
to 
sedition and 
rebellion. And their plots were often hatched in coffee shops.  
The connection between Janissaries, sedition and coffee shops is 
not confined to discontent and political plotting; it includes also 
the presence of yet another subversive element, the immigrants 
who took refuge in Janissary coffee shops and bachelor rooms and 
who ultimately became members of the corps.32 It was not ‘coin-
cidental that bachelors’ chambers in the city were either owned by 
the Janissary coffee house proprietors or built nearby these coffee 
houses’.33 According 
to a 
study by Ahmed Yaşar, 
Janissary 
recruitment of migrants from rural areas was an important cause 
of city banditry.34 Following their relatives or fellow townsmen, 
these migrants shared ethnic or regional origins, took up the same 
jobs and resided in or visited the same cafés.35 Thus, occupa-
tional, regional and ethnic solidarity were forged among new 

123 

"
134,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

immigrants. Together with the pre-existing orta spirit, this social 
cohesion probably made migrants, 
Janissaries 
and migrant-
Janissaries act together to promote their common interest and 
benefit regardless of the laws and norms of the society. Hundreds 
of incidents recorded in the chronicles testify that these people 
constituted one of the most seditious groups.36 
Indeed, not only did Janissary coffee shops embrace marginal 
newcomers but 
they also became centres of discontent and 
grievance. For instance, in the short tenure of the mighty grand 
vizier Alemdar Mustafa Pasha in 1808, some of those who were 
beaten and injured by the vizier’s bodyguards came to Janissary 
coffee houses to complain about the incident and the govern-
ment’s general behaviour. The vizier received death threats, and 
Janissaries finally assassinated him.37 
Thus, armed and generally discontented, the Janissaries became 
an especially volatile and threatening force. And, when the mighty 
‘servitors of the Sultan’ decided to rebel, they were not only 
capable of 
changing governments 
and high-ranking officials 
ranging 
from grand viziers 
to 
their own commander-in-chief 
(Janissary ağa), but also to dethrone the sultan. In the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries, the coffee shop happened to be one of 
those sites connected to Janissary rebellions. The famous Patrona 
Halil rebellion of 1730 is a case in point. The rebellion reflected 
and articulated the resentment of some sectors of society suffering 
poverty, injustice, corruption and neglect,38 and it was sparked off 
in a Janissary coffee house,39 which the insurgents took as a 
meeting place where they could find sympathetic support among 
fellow artisans, street vendors and Janissaries.40 As it happened, 
Kahveci Ali Ağa, the closest friend of the rebellion leader Patrona 
Halil, was the çorbacı (head of the Janissary orta) of the kolluk at 
Çardak İskelesi. He ran what undoubtedly was going to become 
the infamous coffee house belonging to the 56th orta.41 Also, in 
the Kabakçı Mustafa revolt in 1807, Segban Başçavuşu Mustafa 
Ağa, an active figure in the event, ran a coffee house at Atpazarı. 
Likewise, Janissary coffee houses were hot spots during the 1826 
rebellion and many Janissary coffee house owners or keepers were 

124 

"
135,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

executed (some even in front of their own coffee houses) because 
of their active involvement in the events.42 Yet another example is 
Canbaz Kürd Yusuf, who was actively 
involved 
in 
the 1826 
uprising and was eventually executed. During the uprising he is 
said to have met Janissaries in a Janissary coffee house at Sepetçiler 
to exhort them into action.43 In short, Ottoman official fear of and 
displeasure with Janissary coffee houses was warranted and well-
placed. 
As mentioned above, the authorities were extremely disturbed 
by Janissary coffee shops, but were incapable of getting rid of 
them.44 As the nineteenth-century author Mehmed Dâniş Bey 
informs us, if any of their coffee houses were demolished, sedition 
would immediately break out.45 As a matter of fact, from the 
middle of the seventeenth century onwards, instead of banning all 
the coffee houses, the state began to close down a few as a 
deterrent to the others. As Kırlı has suggested in his research on 
nineteenth-century Istanbul coffee shops, the state’s ‘compassion’, 
as expressed through ‘exemplary punishment’ rather than a total 
ban on cafés, may have been due to its fear of political opposition 
at the Janissary coffee houses.46 
But the state’s ‘tolerance’ of the Janissary coffee shop came to an 
end. The decisive blow given to the Janissaries 
in the Vakca-i 
Hayriyye also targeted their coffee houses. According to Mehmed 
Dâniş Bey, more than 10,000 coffee houses located in the old city 
and neighbouring places and on both sides of the Bosporus were 
demolished.47 Indeed, the state understood that to dismantle an 
institution it also had to destroy its supporting structures: the 
coffee shop, which had provided the social cohesion and public 
discourse that allowed the perpetuation of the Janissary ethos, 
was finally destroyed.  

As a centre of Bektashism 
Although Hacı Bektaş Veli, the founder of the Bektashi Sufi order, 
may not have even met a Janissary (he may even have died before 
the establishment of the Ottoman state), Janissary legend had it 
that he personally had established the Janissary corps and served 

125 

"
136,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

them soup from the ‘holy cauldron’ (kazan). Both the name of the 
corps and some of its garments, such as its headgear (börk), are 
also linked to Hacı Bektaş.48 In an age when almost every occu-
pation and art had a pîr (patron-saint), for the military corps a 
Turcoman gâzî, Hacı Bektaş seemed to be the appropriate patron-
saint.49 
With the passage of time, the Janissary corps and Bektashi order 
became so inextricably linked that they were indistinguishable, so 
much so that both suffered the same fate. When the state dis-
mantled the Janissary corps, the Bektashi order was abolished, 
and many of its members were exiled or killed. Like the coffee 
houses, Bektashi tekkes (dervish convents) were closed down and 
sometimes demolished or converted into other kinds of facili-
ties.50 Bektashism was not only simply the official order of the 
corps, but the corps was informed by Bektashi Sufism on all 
ethical, religious, ritual and even literary matters (the figures of 
speech used by Bektashi poets entered into the forms and cere-
monies of the Janissary).51 The connection between Janissaries 
and Bektashis is widely accepted and need not delay us.52 But, it is 
the Bektashi presence in Janissary coffee shops that concerns us 
here.  
From early on in the life of the institution, Janissaries were 
exposed to Bektashi education and culture. Given the role and 
place of the Bektashi order in the corps, it is not surprising to find 
very strong Bektashi influence in the coffee houses where Bek-
tashi rituals and symbols had an important place. Bektashi hymns, 
among others, were often sung. On the walls there were framed 
inscriptions of Bektashi sayings or prayers. Thus, some even sug-
gest that Janissary coffee houses functioned like Bektashi tekkes.53 
In 
fact, 
the 
Janissary 
coffee house 
almost 
‘embodied’ 
the 
Bektashi order. Not only did it physically reflect the primacy of 
the order in the corps by reserving a special sofa inside the coffee 
shop for the baba (head of the order), but the rituals surrounding 
the opening of a Janissary coffee house were very much a joint 
affair between 
the Bektashi order and 
the 
Janissaries, 
thus, 
confirming the interdependence of the two.  

126 

"
137,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

The opening of a Janissary coffee house was marked by a parade 
that started at Ağakapısı at Süleymaniye, where the Janissary ağa 
had his office.54 All the members of the orta to which the coffee 
house owner belonged joined the parade, and they were accom-
panied by the Bektashi baba bearing a Sufi axe, a nefir (a horn) in 
his girdle, and a keşkül (boat-shaped cup) on his arm. Behind the 
baba, walked an officer of the orta who carried the orta insignia to 
the coffee house above his head. On either side walked young 
barber apprentices and coffee servers, followed by the other mem-
bers of the orta; various high-ranking officers accompanied them. 
Upon arrival, the Bektashi baba would sit on the sofa reserved for 
him in the coffee shop, and would be fed and served well. The 
baba would spend the night there. When the time came for him to 
sleep, all the candles would be extinguished in the Bektashi man-
ner except for one, which would continue to burn until morning.  
Thus, 
the old connection between 
the Bektashi order and 
Janissary corps was retained and carried over to the coffee house, 
which became a site where Bektashism not only continued to be 
practised, but actually thrived.  

As a business office 
Some Janissary duties in Istanbul were directly related to the 
economic life of the city. As I mentioned earlier, the 56th orta was 
in charge not only of policing the area around Yemiş İskelesi, but 
also of regulating the distribution of all foodstuffs entering the 
capital, including fresh fruit and vegetables, which were unloaded 
at Çardak İskelesi, right next to the kolluk of the 56th orta.55 The 
orta was also officially responsible for supervising the market for 
timber and other construction materials and fuel for heating. 
Naturally, the kolluk was designated as the ihtisâb office – the 
office responsible for supervising prices and the proper func-
tioning of the market, trade and business. However, what is of 
note is that the famous Çardak coffee house, or Ellialtı Kahvesi, 
situated right next to the kolluk of the 56th orta, was also assigned 
as an ihtisâb office.56 Thus, the coffee shop was not only near, but 
at the heart of trading activities and municipal duties.

The location of coffee houses at the nodes of business, trade and 
commodity distribution allowed some 
Janissary members not 
only to oversee the market, but also actually to participate in it 
and this enabled some of them to become powerful local and 
international traders. Indeed, ‘a large part of foreign commerce, 
particularly the coastal trade to Syria and Egypt, was in their 
[Janissary] hands.’57 It is remarkable that some of these Janissary 
international traders were also coffee shop owners. The case of a 
certain Hacı Hâfız, a Janissary trader and coffee house owner at 
Unkapanı, is an interesting example. He had a dispute with the 
admiral, Seydi Ali Paşa, who claimed to be the owner of a small-
sized merchant ship that Hacı Hâfız had recently bought. The 
admiral ordered the ship to be returned to the maritime arsenal. 
When Hacı Hâfız heard about the order, he gathered together 
some fellow members of his orta, took the ship by force and 
brought it to Unkapanı, where he tied it up in front of his coffee 
house.58 Kahvecioğlu Mustafa Ağa was another example of a café 
owner cum trader. He was a man of great political influence and 
he owned a whole fleet of trade ships, which he had acquired 
through his former post as Tersane Başağası (chief agha of the 
maritime arsenal).59 One can 
imagine 
that 
the coffee houses 
owned by traders doubled as business centres where deals were 
negotiated, contracts drawn up and labour forces recruited.60 If 
the coffee house could function as a market inspection office, why 
not as a business centre? 
Janissary involvement with trade and business is obvious. And 
it is also clear that many of those Janissaries who dealt with trade 
and business also owned coffee houses. One, therefore, may sur-
mise 
that 
in addition 
to providing an extra 
income 
to 
their 
owners, they provided Janissary traders with a 
location 
from 
which to manage their business activities. 

As a ‘mafia’ club 
Let us start with the rather cliché statement that Janissaries were 
famous for being ‘bullies’. They were no longer the choicest of the 
sultan’s servants, but they still held posts (such as policing and 

128 

"
139,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

commodity distribution) that allowed them some control. This 
unique position, coupled with the fact that they were armed, 
meant that the Janissaries were able to intimidate and coerce the 
urban populace. Known as zorbas, some Janissary members led 
‘gangs’ from among their fellow orta members. These zorbas seem 
to have found it useful to own coffee shops, for they doubled as 
‘mafia clubs’ from which to conduct their ‘business’ – and there 
were many examples of such coffee shops (see appendix).61 
While, as we have seen above, some distinguished Janissary 
officers were quite rich, and thus able to establish 
luxurious 
coffee houses with marble hearths, richly decorated ceilings and 
coloured ornamentation, others were less well off.62 The question 
is how did the former afford to establish such lavish cafés? The 
answer is that it was often by unlawful means.  
One method of establishing and financing a Janissary coffee 
shop was through forced ‘contributions’. The zorba would simply 
note down the names of the rich and well-known figures (Muslim 
and non-Muslim) of the district where the coffee shop was to be 
established, along with the items needed for the new coffee house. 
A messenger would then be dispatched to the named residents to 
‘convey greetings’ and announce the expected ‘gift’.63 The named 
resident would then have to send the requested item without 
hesitation or delay, sometimes personally bringing the item to the 
coffee house.64 Furthermore, 
the cost of 
the upkeep of 
the 
Janissary coffee house would sometimes be provided by forcing 
all the residents of the area (both rich and poor) to pay racket or 
protection money.65 The residents had no choice but to comply 
because refusal may well have resulted in the person’s house 
being burnt down.  
Another method of 
financing 
the establishment and main-
tenance of a coffee house was to raise money through the practice 
of ‘axe-hanging’ (balta asma). When an axe (balta), carrying the 
insignia of the orta, was placed or hung on a commodity or 
property, it announced ‘rightful’ proprietorship by the orta. Thus, 
axe-hanging was sometimes plain extortion or wrongful seizure of 
a commodity or property, and at other times a means of imposing 

129 

"
140,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

the Janissary’s terms and conditions on a business. To cite an 
example, if a person wanted to build a house in Istanbul, he 
would need to bribe the zorba of his district.66 If he failed to do 
so, 
the orta’s axe would be hung on 
the construction 
site 
announcing ‘who was in charge’, thereby scaring away the con-
struction workers hired 
for the 
job, who would be afraid to 
continue working without 
the zorba’s 
sanction.67 Collecting 
protection money through axe-hanging was a standard method 
used to establish and maintain Janissary coffee shops.68 
Such 
‘mafia’-like activities were not only used to open and 
maintain coffee shops, but they were also directed from these 
selfsame coffee houses. Thus, zorba cafés situated near Istanbul’s 
ports, especially those 
in the Galata area, were 
located there 
precisely to enable the orta to survey the movement of trade ships 
for 
the purposes of 
either 
collecting protection money or 
establishing a monopoly over 
the relevant 
trade or business. 
Incoming ships would be ‘axe-hung’ until such time as the terms 
of the zorba had been met.69 From time to time the state prose-
cuted those who were involved in this practice and, in spite of 
fierce opposition from the Janissaries, would have all the ‘axes’ 
removed from the ships in order to clamp down on the Janissary’s 
‘mafia’ activities at the port.70 
Another 
form of 
‘mafia’ activity 
that 
involved coffee house 
owners was debt collection. For example, we have the case of a 
priest in Istanbul who was unable to collect a debt, so sought the 
help of Yetimoğlu, a naval officer and coffee house owner. The 
latter collected the debt and took a 50 per cent cut. Due to a 
certain misdeed and defiance of official orders, Yetimoğlu was 
arrested in his coffee house at Sandıkçılar, Galata and taken to the 
admiral’s ship where he was executed in 1811.71 
Although friendly relations between the members of different 
ortas were not uncommon, competition between the different 
messes over 
trade and service monopolies and 
the 
‘right’ 
to 
extortion would cause disputes, and often fierce clashes.72 
While the great zorbas tried to restrict their involvement and 
activities to particular areas, territorial delimitation sometimes did 

130 

"
141,"JANISSARY COFFEE HOUSES 

not meet consensus and would result in the parties concerned 
having to ‘fight it out’.73 For instance, if an axe hung by an orta 
was removed by another orta, 
then 
that would 
immediately 
trigger a fierce battle in the city between the two gangs, which no 
authority could prevent.74 These bloody skirmishes would cause 
loss of life and, perhaps, the elimination of one or other of the 
warring parties.75 
As one might expect, in these wars over monopolies, money 
racketeering and ‘axe-hanging’ rights, one of the main sites that 
were targeted for attack was exactly the place that enabled the 
orta’s access and control: the Janissary coffee house.76 

Conclusion 

The economic and political changes 
that 
took place 
in 
the 
eighteenth century forced the once elite and relatively isolated 
Janissary corps out of its barracks and into the city, where it 
found refuge in the institution of the coffee house. The coffee 
house business, which was in and of itself easy to establish, not 
only allowed Janissaries to 
integrate 
into the 
fabric of urban 
civilian life, but it also enabled them to gain access to and control 
over the city’s markets, businesses and trade. The coffee shop was 
capacious enough to accommodate the wide range of activities the 
Janissaries conducted beyond the call of their military duties. In 
it, not only were they able to engage in the usual repertoire of 
social, cultural and political activities that took place in ‘regular’ 
coffee houses, but they were also able to service their own specific 
cultural needs and requirements, often associated with promoting 
the 
‘orta-spirit’ and practising Bektashism. They were able to 
continue to perform their policing and market-inspection duties 
and, above all, to engage in various activities that went beyond 
the legal and cultural norms set or accepted by the state and 
society. While the Janissary coffee house was a place in which to 
drink coffee and smoke tobacco, it was also a cultural salon, a 
rebel headquarters, a police precinct, a Sufi lodge, a business 
office and a mafia club all rolled into one.

The Heart’s Desire: Gender, 
Urban Space and the Ottoman 
Coffee House 

Alan Mikhail 

A well-known Hadīth 
reported 
by 
Ibn Hibbān 
states 
that 
‘happiness has four elements: a good wife, a spacious house, a 
good neighbour, and a comfortable riding beast’.1 While perhaps 
this statement by 
the Prophet Muhammad never crossed 
the 
minds of most Ottoman urban residents or coffee house patrons, 
it points to a relationship between women, the home and the 
neighbourhood 
that 
the Ottoman urban neighbourhood café 
helps us to elucidate. I argue in what follows that Ottoman urban 
cafés were important spaces in the geography of Ottoman cities 
because they serve to highlight and challenge the complex nature 
of urban space and conceptions of gender in the Ottoman world. 
Attempting to move beyond café histories that posit the Ottoman 
coffee house as primarily a site of political subversion, I seek to 
understand the café as a cultural space of socialization that served 
multiple functions within the city beyond representing simply a 
space in which Janissaries could gather and discuss politics.2 It 
should be noted at the start that I am concerned mainly with 
urban neighbourhood 
coffee houses 
(mahalle 
kahvehaneleri) 
rather than with Janissary or guild cafés or with those in small 
towns or in large commercial complexes known as khāns.3 In 
other words, I am interested in those cafés in urban quarters of 
Istanbul, Cairo and Aleppo that were mainstays in the lives of 

133 

 
"
144,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

neighbourhood residents, where men would often go to see their 
friends and to relax in a space near their homes.4 
When 
first approaching 
the Ottoman urban neighbourhood 
café, we should take care to note that we really have no vocab-
ulary for discussing urban space as it was understood by Ottoman 
city residents. As Cem Behar notes in his study of one Istanbul 
neighbourhood, ‘It remains that the interface between the public 
and the private domains in Ottoman cities, and its evolution and 
its relationship to Ottoman urban culture in general is a topic not 
yet sufficiently investigated.’5 We do not know what kinds of 
spaces were thought of as ‘public’ or ‘private’, but it seems clear 
that these words and the notions they represent prove a hindrance 
rather than an aid in describing Ottoman cities. Indeed, in her 
work on the harem, Leslie Peirce shows ‘that a dichotomy of 
public/commonweal/male and private/domestic/female does not 
work for early modern Ottoman society’.6 She suggests instead 
that we centre our discussions on the concepts of inner and outer, 
or 
the 
interior and exterior. The relevant 
terms 
in Ottoman 
Turkish are iç or içeri for inner or interior and dış or dışarı (or 
taşra) for outer or exterior.7 Suggestive also are Gabriel Piterberg’s 
descriptions of the Ottoman usages of ‘the garden’ and ‘the wilder-
ness’ as signifiers of Istanbul and the provinces respectively.8 
Alternatively, perhaps we could think in terms of the city in 
opposition 
to 
the palace. Walter Andrews proposes 
that we 
examine the ‘closely related oppositions of smooth/striated space, 
and nomadic/royal approaches to human behaviour’.9 My goal in 
raising 
these differing conceptions of space 
in 
the Ottoman 
empire is not to suggest that we must find a definitive spatial 
vocabulary. Instead, I want to make the point that these various 
ideas of space within the Ottoman world existed in concert with 
one another, and to suggest a rigid conceptualization of space 
within 
the Ottoman 
empire would 
in 
all 
likelihood prove 
ineffective in describing the vast multiplicity of spaces that made 
up the Ottoman world. Indeed, we can go even further and posit 
that no single dichotomization of space could accurately reflect 
Ottoman urban realities. Building on the ideas of Ottoman space 

134 

"
145,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

mentioned above and hoping to move beyond simple notions of 
‘public’ versus ‘private’ or ‘male’ versus ‘female’, I seek to show in 
this chapter how the Ottoman coffee house was a space of over-
lapping functions in which a spectrum of ambiences and affects 
fluidly combined to form a complex realm of social interaction. 
I should state at the outset that while perhaps initially appealing 
to historians of coffee houses in the Ottoman world – or any-
where else for that matter – Habermas’s arguments about the 
public sphere prove a hindrance rather than an aid in thinking 
about Ottoman cafés and their many roles in Ottoman cities.10 
The reason I raise this point at all and offer my own critique of 
Habermas’s formulations is that many Ottoman historians con-
tinue to attempt to salvage some form of Habermas’s arguments in 
discussing Ottoman cafés.11 Habermas’s goal in his study is to 
understand how the conversations of individuals become bases 
for political action.12 He thus traces the emergence of a bourgeois 
public sphere from its beginnings in the meetings of groups of 
educated and propertied European men through its expansion in 
the form of large-scale social organizations – such as print media 
and coffee houses – to its demise. Habermas grounds his argu-
ments firmly in the context of the relationships between capital-
ism and the state in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 
offering us an alternative way of thinking about the interactions 
between state and society during this period. 
What proves highly problematic in Habermas’s account and 
what is most important for my own arguments in this chapter is 
Habermas’s incessant insistence on ‘the line between public and 
private’, which separates the public world of cafés and the market 
from the private space of the home and family.13 He writes that 
‘the model of the bourgeois public sphere presupposed strict 
separation of the public from the private realm.’14 What I seek to 
show 
in 
this chapter 
is 
that Ottoman coffee houses help 
to 
explode this dichotomy between ‘the public’ and ‘the private’ (or 
whatever vocabulary we choose to talk about Ottoman space) 
proving that this distinction is not tenable in the Ottoman world. 
Ottoman cafés were at differing moments domestic spaces, places 

135 

"
146,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

of business and leisure, an extension of the street or market, a 
venue of entertainment, a space of courtship, an arena of commu-
nication, a place in which to read and a realm of distraction. We 
should not think in terms of lines and boundaries when concep-
tualizing the Ottoman spaces of which coffee houses were an 
integral part, but in terms of layers and multiplicity.15 
Habermas’s rendering of the European public sphere and its 
relations to the early modern coffee house also holds important 
consequences for women and the relationships between gender 
and modernity. He writes: 

Critical debate ignited by works of literature and art was 
soon extended to include economic and political disputes, 
without any guarantee (such as was given in the salons) 
that such discussions would be inconsequential, at least in 
the 
immediate context. The 
fact 
that only men were 
admitted to coffee-house society may have had something 
to do with this, whereas the style of the salon, like that of 
the rococo in general, was essentially shaped by women.16 

On the exclusionary mechanisms at work in this account that 
eliminate from the public sphere women and the lower classes, 
one commenter writes, ‘when women are shut out of the coffee-
house they are also, in the terms of this analysis [Habermas’s], 
shut out of a constitutive 
role 
in 
the development of 
the 
intellectual and political self-consciousness of the bourgeoisie, the 
emergence of characteristically modern literary forms and of a 
reading public, the initiation of democratic forms of participation 
in society.’17 As Habermas would have it then, the coffee house 
was a male institution of the public realm where men with a 
vested interest in and control over their own caffeinated futures 
debated rumour, politics and society. Much scholarship on the 
Ottoman world 
continues 
to uphold 
both 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
Habermasian split between ‘public’ and ‘private’ and the notion 
that this ‘public’ is male. Take the following for example: ‘as we 
try to imagine the social context of culture in the early modern 

136 

"
147,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

period both in the Ottoman empire and elsewhere, we must keep 
in mind that public space at the time was male space.’18 Again, I 
argue below that Ottoman coffee houses stand in almost complete 
opposition to these ideas since they were spaces in which men 
gossiped 
(perhaps, as 
I 
shall 
show below, more 
than 
they 
rumoured) and, more importantly, in which notions of male and 
female gender were essential to the socializations taking place 
within them. Through a discussion near the end of this chapter of 
Ottoman poetry and its representations of coffee and coffee house 
servant boys, I show how the female was a complicatedly impor-
tant aspect of the masculine world of the Ottoman coffee house. 
Instead of Habermas’s strict world of dichotomies, I propose 
that we think of Ottoman coffee houses in terms of what Michel 
Foucault calls a heterotopia, or a space ‘capable of juxtaposing in a 
single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves 
incompatible’.19 
For Foucault, heterotopias are places connected 
to specific 
known cultural referents that are able to rearrange and combine 
these familiar signs in a new and useful way. In his own words, 
heterotopias ‘have the curious property of being in relation with 
all the other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or 
invert the set of relations that they happen to designate, mirror, or 
reflect’.20 Ottoman coffee houses did 
just this as spaces with 
connections to the neighbourhood, home and market that made 
them at once familiar but contemporaneously novel in the way 
that men could gather within them as spaces of layered function-
ality and a multitude of ambiences. 
The association of coffee and its consumption with a place of 
socialization is one that emerges almost from the very beginning 
of coffee’s entrance into the Muslim world. Exactly when coffee 
first appeared in the region is, however, under some dispute. 
Ralph Hattox places coffee’s beginnings in the Middle East in the 
middle of the fifteenth century.21 Others claim that there is no 
mention of coffee in any sources before the sixteenth century.22 
As to when coffee first arrived in Istanbul, again we do not know 
exactly, although it was some time during the middle decades of 

137 

"
148,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

the sixteenth century. The Ottoman historian İbrahim Peçevi 
writes that before 1554 coffee and coffee houses did not exist in 
Istanbul, but in that year two men – Hakem from Aleppo and 
Şems from Damascus – brought coffee to Istanbul and quickly 
opened the city’s 
first coffee house 
in the neighbourhood of 
Tahtakale.23 According to Kātip Çelebi, coffee 
first arrived 
in 
Istanbul in 1543.24 The historian Mustafa Âli, for his part, claims 
that coffee houses first appeared in Istanbul and ‘in other regions 
of the Well-Guarded State’ some time in 1552 or 1553.25  
Nevertheless, what is important for our present purposes is not 
the exact date of the arrival of coffee in the Middle East, but the 
fact that the places in which it was consumed and the social 
rituals constructed around this consumption became more sig-
nificant than the actual drink. Commentators have noted that 
coffee houses became an inseparably synergistic component of the 
meaning of coffee in the Muslim world.26 At the linguistic level, 
we note that coffee houses are usually referred to as simply kahve 
in Turkish or qahwa in Arabic. These words literally mean the 
drink, coffee, but their use to signify coffee houses suggests a 
nearly equivalent relationship imagined between coffee and the 
places in which it was drunk. 
Coffee houses were not only intimately linked to the caffeinated 
libations that patrons consumed 
in them, but they were also 
integral parts of Ottoman urban geography. Soon after coffee’s 
arrival, coffee houses could be seen all over the major urban areas 
of the Ottoman empire. Writing at the turn of the seventeenth 
century, Mustafa Âli claims that in Cairo ‘thousands of coffee 
houses are in operation’.27 Later he comments, ‘[Remarkable] is 
the multitude of coffee-houses in the city of Cairo, the concen-
tration of coffee-houses at every step, and of perfect places where 
people can assemble.’28 At the end of the eighteenth century, the 
British traveller to Aleppo Alexander Russell notes that ‘coffee-
houses naturally attract the notice of a stranger, more than any of 
the objects he meets with in rambling over the city. They are 
found in all quarters of the town, and some of them are spacious 
and handsome.’29  

138 

"
149,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

In sixteenth-century Istanbul a few decades after coffee came to 
the city, Katip Çelebi writes, 
‘They were opened everywhere, 
freely: on every street-corner a coffee-house appeared.’30 Peçevi 
notes that cafés became so popular in the sixteenth century that 
there were often no places to sit or stand because they were so 
crowded. It reached the point where no one was going to the 
mosque any more.31 The historian Cengiz Kırlı asserts that at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century one out of every seven or 
eight businesses in Istanbul was a coffee house. The neighbour-
hood of Beşiktaş alone had 22 cafés out of a total of 108 coffee 
houses situated in neighbourhoods along the Bosporus.32 Writing 
about the same period, the nineteenth-century British traveller 
Charles White estimated that Istanbul was home to no fewer than 
2500 coffee houses.33 
Part of the reason for the ubiquity of cafés in urban locales was 
the important fact that they were opened almost immediately 
whenever a new neighbourhood of a city was developed or when 
new economic configurations seemed promising for café business. 
Indeed, along with homes, coffee houses were some of the first 
structures to appear in newly constructed neighbourhoods. In 
1771, in the area of Cairo along the Nile known as Būlāq, cAlī Bey 
undertook a project to construct a khān complex complete with 
residential areas, a mosque and storage facilities. The project was 
so huge that it extended into the Nile and the flow of the river 
was actually diverted 
in order 
to reclaim 
land 
for 
the city. 
Residents of Cairo quickly moved to this newly available land 
and, as narrated by the Egyptian historian of the eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries cAbd al-Rahmān al-Jabartī, the first two 
structures built on this 
land were houses and cafés.34 Coffee 
houses were also some of the first businesses opened in any 
complex devoted to commerce. When the construction of all the 
stores in a certain Cairo wakāla was complete, the first thing to be 
added to the complex before its opening was a coffee attendant’s 
(qahwajī) stand.35 Likewise, when Ismācīl Bey opened a 
large 
business complex (qaysariyya) in 1787, he was sure to include a 
coffee house along with his 21 shops so that customers would not 

139 

"
150,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

have to leave the area to drink their coffee.36 Interestingly, during 
the French occupation of Egypt, 
local Egyptians 
took 
the 
presence of the French in their midst as a business opportunity to 
open up coffee houses around 
the French military’s 
living 
quarters.37 
As one of the most visible trappings of Ottoman culture, coffee 
houses emerged wherever humans went. The Amīr Qāsim Bey 
Abū Sayf, who had a certain flare for architecture (kāna lahu 
malaka wa fikra fī handasat al-bināɔ), built a huge palace complete 
with a very ornate garden of running water, myrtle and willow 
trees, and all sorts of shaded areas. He opened this garden to the 
general public and it immediately became a very popular place in 
which to stroll and escape the heat. As soon as people began 
frequenting this garden in significant numbers, Amīr Qāsim Bey 
Abū Sayf decided to open a coffee house there. Al-Jabartī speaks 
almost in the same breath of the increasing numbers of visitors to 
this place and the opening of a café in the garden as if the latter 
were a requisite of the former.38 
As a backdrop to this discussion, we should remember that 
serving and consuming food was of the utmost importance to the 
social life of the Ottoman city in the eighteenth century.39 Around 
this 
basic 
element 
of 
life 
revolved 
numerous 
rituals 
of 
socialization, leisure and politics. Eating in this world was most 
closely associated with the family and home, for there was no 
such thing as a culture of restaurants and eating out was rare.40 
When people did eat outside their own homes it was usually in 
the home of a friend or family member.  
The question of whether or not families had kitchens in their 
homes is obviously an important factor in assessing the culture of 
eating in the Ottoman world, but it is an enquiry that has not yet 
received a definitive answer. Nelly Hanna estimates in her study 
of seventeenth and eighteenth-century homes in Cairo that only 
14 per cent of medium-sized homes included kitchens.41 This 
relatively low number though does not mean that only 14 per 
cent of Cairene 
families cooked 
in 
their homes. As Hanna 
explains, families utilized a kānūn (a portable grill) to cook meat 

140 

"
151,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

in or near their homes, since this mobile cooking apparatus could 
be shared by many different households on the basis of need.42 In 
the case of eighteenth-century Aleppo, Abraham Marcus suggests 
that almost all homes – including those that cost as little as eight 
piasters – contained kitchens.43 Marcus’s findings though stand in 
contrast to the work of Antoine Abdel-Nour who asserts that only 
a fifth of all homes in Aleppo in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries contained kitchens.44  
In 
seventeenth-century 
Jerusalem, Dror Zeɔevi’s 
study 
of 
inheritance records indicates that most families had knives (but 
no forks and spoons) in their homes along with pots, pans and 
various sorts of plates.45 This of course suggests that families ate 
in their homes, but does not necessarily mean they cooked in 
them. While 
the question of 
the role of 
the kitchen 
in 
the 
Ottoman home remains unanswered, the consensus in the above 
scholarship is that families usually ate at home.  
One of the most important parts of Ottoman culinary life in this 
domestic setting was the recognized and celebrated tradition of 
the dinner party.46 These dinner parties of course included much 
more than just food as they were also leisure events to be enjoyed 
with friends and family. Smoking, chatting, playing backgammon 
or other games, gossiping and drinking coffee were all requisite 
parts of a fine evening. One exception to the general rule that 
residents of Ottoman cities only ate or drank in their homes was 
the coffee house. Indeed, the coffee house was the one place 
outside the home where people could share in all the revelries of 
an enjoyable dinner party without the presence of a meal. 
Another important social change ushered in by the widespread 
emergence of Ottoman urban coffee houses was that they served 
as places of nocturnal socialization outside 
the home.47 The 
Englishman 
John Fryer, writing of his visits 
to seventeenth-
century Persian cafés, states that ‘at night here are abundance of 
lamps lighted, and let down in glasses from the concave part of 
the roof, by wires or ropes, hanging in a circle.’48 When the sun 
set and the streets emptied, people were usually either at home or 
in their 
local café.49 Indeed, al-Jabartī relates that during the 

141 

"
152,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

month of Ramadān, people in Cairo spent their nights either at 
home or in coffee houses.50  
Coffee’s association with the night-time machinations of 
its 
consumers contributed 
to official apprehensions about coffee 
houses during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Never-
theless, ‘conquering the night’ was both a source of pride and 
excitement for urbanites and a way for local authorities to show 
their control over an area.51 When the French were about to 
invade Cairo in 1798, tensions arose in many neighbourhoods 
throughout the city about the impending danger. In an effort to 
comfort the city’s residents, local authorities ordered all markets 
and coffee houses to open at night and requested that lanterns 
(qanādīl) be hung throughout these areas to dispel gloom from 
people’s hearts and to gain a semblance of society and com-
panionship (dhahāb al-wahsha min al-qulūb wa husūl al-istiɔnās).52 
Later we read that during the celebration of cArafa (the ninth day 
of the pilgrimage month), coffee houses and businesses were 
joy and delight (al-farah wa al-
opened to create a mood of 
surūr).53 Both these examples reveal the important associations 
between coffee houses and the joy derived from their night-time 
patronage. 
Coffee extended the day for its male imbibers well beyond dusk 
and this meant that they were often out of their homes and apart 
from 
their 
families 
for 
longer periods 
than was previously 
observed. Coffee was, moreover, a beverage consumed by all, and 
members of all social classes 
frequented coffee houses, even 
though the rich could afford to drink it at home. The nineteenth-
century British traveller, Charles White terms coffee both ‘the 
solace of the rich and the principal sustenance of the poor’.54 
Peçevi, writing in the seventeenth century, notes that those men 
of high standing who were not prominent functionaries of the 
state (eshāb-ı menāsıbdan gayri kibār) had no choice but to come 
to cafés since they were all the rage.55  
Nevertheless, the association between coffee and the poor and 
destitute 
is repeated over and over again by chroniclers and 
contemporary observers alike. Commenting on the poverty of the 

142 

"
153,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

people of Cairo at the end of the sixteenth century, Mustafa Âli 
writes, ‘The pious and the poor of the country live in perpetual 
abstemiousness. Most of them are content with coffee as a liquid 
and roasted coffee-beans and one or two dry biscuits as solid 
food.’56 Later he describes café goers as ‘a bunch of parasites … 
whose work consists of presiding over 
the coffee house, of 
drinking coffee on credit, [and of] talking of frugality’.57 Al-Jabartī 
describes the management of coffee houses as one of the lowest or 
most menial forms of labour (one of al-hiraf al-danīɔa) akin to fish 
frying 
or 
pastry 
selling.58 
In 
sixteenth-century 
Ottoman 
Jerusalem, we 
learn 
that what Ottoman 
authorities 
termed 
‘wickedness, mischief, perniciousness and refractoriness’ often 
accompanied the economically destitute café patrons of that city 
leading to official fears about the spread of coffee houses as the 
meeting places of such rabble.59 
Considering how poor many of the men who went to cafés 
were, how might we explain their frequent patronage given the 
associated costs?60 To begin answering this question we must first 
locate the coffee house in the social world of the Ottoman city 
and specifically within the context of the city neighbourhood 
(mahalle in Turkish, mahalla in Arabic).61 Coffee houses were 
sprinkled throughout the various neighbourhoods of Ottoman 
cities. During his travels in Egypt, Evliya Çelebi describes more 
than 40 neighbourhoods in Cairo, and almost every single one of 
them, regardless of its size, had at least one coffee house. In the 
neighbourhood of Kefri Cedid, for instance, Evliya Çelebi informs 
us that there were 200 homes, a mosque and a coffee house. In 
Kefri Nahe, a neighbourhood of 1000 homes and a mosque, there 
were no shops, hammāms, or vekāles, but there was a café. He 
writes of all kinds of coffee houses in all kinds of neighbourhoods 
terming 
some 
cafés Arab 
kahvehaneleri 
and others 
fellâhîn 
kahvehaneleri.62 From Evliya Çelebi’s account, we get a sense of 
Cairo as a city made up of many different neighbourhood parts, in 
each of which the local café was a central hub worthy of mention. 
Like most cities at this time, Ottoman cities were relatively 
small, stretching at most for two or three miles from one end to 

143 

"
154,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

the other. Within this compact space, however, was a densely 
packed network of 
roads, many different kinds of houses, 
businesses, religious institutions, coffee houses, hammāms, waqf 
complexes, public fountains and a whole range of other kinds of 
spaces. Within the official Ottoman mental mindscape, the city 
stood in opposition to the palace. Whereas the latter was sophis-
ticated and learned, the former was vulgar, common and uncouth. 
Mustafa Âli, 
for 
example, 
ascribes 
the disgusting habits of 
‘someone of inferior quality’ to that person’s ‘city nature’, which 
he employs as a foil to the manners observed in the company of 
‘great men’.63 Elsewhere, he differentiates the palace from the city 
by likening the former to a pearl hidden ‘in the depth of the oyster 
shell’.64 
This 
imagery 
eloquently 
accentuates 
the 
absolute 
authority vested in the sultan and his palace as the centres from 
which all 
imperial power emanates. Leslie Peirce suggestively 
terms the courtyard of the 
inner palace 
‘the all-male harem’, 
pointing again both to the spatial and symbolic impenetrability of 
this space and to its seclusion from other sections of the palace 
and from the city.65 
Within the city the majority of urban residents spent most of 
their lives in one neighbourhood, rarely venturing beyond their 
local sphere of activity because all their daily needs could be met 
in their immediate social surroundings. The neighbourhood was 
therefore the self-sufficient axis around which urban life revolved 
for most Ottoman city dwellers. It was, in other words, ‘the most 
intimate social unit outside the family’.66 In each neighbourhood 
there was a small market for daily goods, perhaps a small mosque, 
a butcher shop, fruit vendors, and other institutions providing 
vital social services.  
The residents of these tightly woven communities necessarily 
saw one another quite regularly, and this fostered a distinctive 
sense of local neighbourhood identity, which often took on the 
characteristics of an extended family.67 Since everyone in these 
neighbourhoods knew their neighbours, strangers were imme-
diately noticed. This level of intimacy was not, however, all in the 
spirit of camaraderie and goodwill; 
it also produced a social 

144 

"
155,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

milieu in which people regularly talked about others, about what 
they were doing in their homes and about how they interacted 
with others within 
the 
community 
and 
elsewhere. Regular 
meetings in the streets of a neighbourhood, at the local vendor, or 
near the public fountain meant a constant atmosphere of gossip, 
prying and general curiosity about one’s neighbours.  
Nonetheless, these neighbourhood communities seem to have 
observed a set of unwritten rules about social interactions, the use 
of space and the spirit of the neighbourhood.68 Urban residents 
could use space as they pleased as long as they did not infringe on 
the privacy, health, safety or comfort of their neighbours, or of 
the community as a whole. The popular Arabic saying ‘al-jār qabl 
al-dār’ (the neighbour [comes] before the house) embodies this 
notion of the wellbeing and security of the local whole over the 
interests of the individual. Practically, this meant that issues such 
as the construction of new buildings, extensions or add-ons to 
existing structures, water usage and the maintenance of streets 
and thoroughfares were negotiated and regulated by and among 
neighbours with a shared interest in their common spaces.69 
Space within Ottoman neighbourhoods was 
fluid and over-
lapping and should not be understood in terms of divisions and 
distinctions. How, 
for 
instance, do we 
interpret the 
fact that 
neighbourhood affairs that affected the community as a whole 
were controlled by private individuals jockeying with one another 
for their own advantage? Interiors of homes were reserved for the 
eyes of family members and invited guests only, yet the noise of 
the neighbourhood and its gossip travelled freely in and out of 
houses, onto the street, into shops and back again. Often what the 
eye could not see the ear could hear.70 Moreover, there were 
numerous kinds of spaces within Ottoman neighbourhoods where 
domestic life spilled out onto the street or where the affairs of the 
neighbourhood came into the home. As an example of the former, 
we should remember 
that dead-end streets shared by a 
few 
families provided an extra space in which to do chores or store 
excess supplies of wood and other necessities for the home.71  
Those whose houses did not border this space or who had not 

145 

"
156,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

explicitly been invited by members of these families were often 
not allowed to enter the area at all. This space then was in some 
senses an extension of the home outside its physical boundaries.72 
As Cem 
Behar 
explains with 
reference 
to 
the 
Istanbul 
neighbourhood of Kasap İlyas, ‘The Istanbulites, in their public 
life, often 
saw 
their mahalle as a direct extension of 
their 
untouchable 
individual private space, of 
their 
inner personal 
domain.’73 We shall return to these issues of space and the city 
below, but suffice it to say for now that this is a rough sketch of 
the urban world in which the Ottoman coffee house flourished. 
As neighbourhood institutions catering to regulars who lived 
nearby, coffee houses thrived in this fluid world of local com-
munities where spaces played multiple and overlapping roles not 
adequately described by terms like ‘public’ and ‘private’. I would 
like to suggest that neighbourhood cafés in the poorer sections of 
Ottoman Istanbul, Cairo and Aleppo might be better understood 
by looking for clues within rather than away from the home. By 
this 
I mean 
that urban cafés offered 
their male clientele a 
substitute for a selamlık, the name given to the section of the 
house reserved for the men of the family to greet and socialize 
with their guests.74  
A great many families in these cities could not afford large 
houses with separate selamlık and haremlik (the comparable space 
of female socialization) and therefore could not entertain guests 
in 
their 
homes 
given 
the 
traditionally-observed 
separation 
between male and female guests in the home.75 As Dina Khouri 
notes 
in her work on Mosul, separate domains 
for men and 
women within the household become less and less common as 
one moves down the economic social ladder.76  
Contrasting the homes of Ottoman urban residents with the 
villas, gardens and orchards of the wealthy, Mustafa Âli had this 
to say: ‘there exists another gloomy prison for downcast people 
who are tight, silent, and afflicted, and which is narrow like the 
hard heart of 
the miser, 
a 
torturesome 
and grief-inflicting 
gathering place entirely enveloped in torment and misery and 
suffering.’77 Though perhaps an exaggeration, Âli’s description 

146 

"
157,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

makes the point that most Ottoman houses were rather small and 
cramped spaces. The coffee house then gave poorer men a chance 
to have their own sort of communal selamlık in which to ‘take up 
residence’, in Âli’s words, with their friends and associates while 
at the same time affording women their own autonomous zones 
of conviviality 
in 
the 
space of 
the home 
refashioned as a 
haremlik.78 
For the lower and middle classes, the price of constructing 
separate male and female spaces within the home was prohibitive, 
yet women were still able to maintain autonomous areas within 
the home. Although all members of the family, whether female or 
male, shared this section of the home, known as the bayt, it ‘was 
rarely divisible and appears to have been the only truly private 
space of the women and their children’.79 Thus, women shaped 
the hierarchies and relations of 
their homes and households 
because 
it was the home more than any other 
institution or 
structure in the Ottoman city that constituted the bulk of most 
people’s personal wealth.80 Nevertheless, when one looks at the 
dwellings of the poor majorities of Ottoman cities, any divisions 
between male and female are hard to find given that most of these 
houses consisted of a large common room where family members 
sat together, ate, socialized and slept. Some lower-class families 
we should note were able to afford a house with a small courtyard 
and a room for storage, but this seems to be quite rare and was 
only possible after a 
long period of saving money or after 
acquiring a large inheritance or some other similar increase in 
income. The majority of the population, therefore, did not have 
domestic spaces within their homes in which males or females 
could gather 
together without 
the other 
to entertain 
friends, 
conduct business, eat, relax or host guests. 
It is this absence of a domestic selamlık and haremlik within 
poorer households that leads me to identify the coffee house as 
the crucial Ottoman institution that allowed men and women 
their autonomous zones of socialization. On this subject, Mustafa 
Âli observes that ‘indigents and poor people go there [to the café] 
because they have no home or shelter. For indeed the poor have 

147 

"
158,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

neither cash nor worldly goods enabling them to gather anywhere 
else. This is the reason they are in constant attendance at coffee 
houses.’81  
Ehud Toledano makes a similar point when he writes that ‘the 
Ottoman-Egyptian elite socialized mostly at home, as the male 
section 
(selamlık) of most 
elite houses could 
accommodate 
visitors quite comfortably. So it was for those with modest homes, 
or no home at all, that the coffee house was ever so important.’82 
Ottoman mahalle cafés offered the neighbourhood’s men a place 
in which to gather with their male companions 
in a sort of 
communal selamlık while at the same time affording women the 
home as an autonomous, albeit temporary, female space.  
Coffee houses were, of course, not the only reasons men left 
their homes. Indeed, like places of work and worship, Ottoman 
cafés allowed for two similar processes to occur simultaneously. 
On the one hand, with men out of the home, women temporally 
made their domestic space into a place of gathering, a quasi-
public space in which non-kin and friends could assemble to 
discuss neighbourhood affairs, conduct business, gossip and relax 
with one another. At the same time, men engaged in a similar sort 
of socialization in coffee houses. We might suggest then that the 
café was a space that had more in common with the domestic 
world of the home than it did with the city, its streets and public 
thoroughfares. 
Likewise, we might 
view 
the home 
as 
an 
occasional space 
in which women gathered 
to converse and 
perform 
their 
socializations. Commenting 
on 
this 
former 
phenomenon while completely ignoring the latter, the scholar of 
coffee houses Ralph Hattox mentions ‘the occasional transferal of 
the act of hospitality from the home to the coffee house’.83 Indeed, 
if the coffee house was to serve as their selamlık, men had to have 
the sense that they were in a familiar space, a space that might be 
taken as their home even though it was not. To get a better sense 
of exactly how this temporary imagining of the coffee house as 
the home took place, it is instructive for us to enter the physical 
realm of the Ottoman café to see what its men saw and to feel 
what they felt. 

148

159,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

Before actually setting foot in the coffee house a customer often 
had to remove his shoes and place them in a small container near 
the door called a pabuçluk.84 This custom of removing one’s 
footwear before entering the café was most common in Anatolian 
coffee houses and of course 
immediately reminds one of the 
practice 
observed when 
entering 
a mosque 
or 
the home. 
Importantly, 
in all 
these places, 
the removal of one’s shoes 
symbolizes the crossing of a threshold between the outside world 
of dirt, the street and the city on the one hand and the comfort-
able familiarity of the home, mosque or coffee house on the other.  
Mahalle coffee houses were usually single-storeyed wooden 
structures with wooden floors, although some café floors were 
covered with carpets. A coffee house was most often located in a 
small square at the meeting point of several streets near shops, the 
mosque and 
fountains. The cafés 
in these mahalle centres of 
gravity were often surrounded by small gardens or clusters of 
trees.  
Upon entering the coffee house, one would first find oneself in 
the large common area known as the orta or meydan, which took 
up most of the café interior. This area was similar to the living 
room of a house, into which guests are greeted when they first 
enter and, like that part of a house, this was where most café 
patrons spent most of their time sitting on small wooden chairs or 
slightly raised divans with their coffee and waterpipe. One corner 
of the café housed the equivalent of a kitchen where fincans and 
coffee-making equipment were stored. More importantly, this was 
also where all the coffee was brewed on a small furnace known as 
an ocak.85  
In the corner opposite the ocak was the başsedir, the top divan, 
where local notables and distinguished men of the neighbourhood 
sat. The başsedir was the spatial pinnacle of the coffee house 
social hierarchy. It was from this elevated point that neighbour-
hood elders, imams and important tradesmen made announce-
ments, disseminated neighbourhood news and sometimes gave 
lessons or 
told stories. Again, 
this café social order and 
its 
physical manifestations remind one of the situation prevailing in 

149 

"
160,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

the home where the kitchen was usually on the side of the house 
opposite 
the entrance and where 
the 
father’s 
favourite 
seat 
occupied an important position within the household hierarchy.86 
The café built in the waqf complex of İpshîr Mustapha Pasha in 
Aleppo provides one of the most striking examples of the resem-
blance between a coffee house and an individual home. According 
to Evliya Çelebi, who visited Aleppo in 1671, the city was full of 
cafés; in fact there were 105 in all.87 The waqf complex of İpshîr 
Pasha, located in the northern suburb of Aleppo, was the largest 
charitable endowment built in the city during the seventeenth 
century, and one of its most socially and architecturally important 
features was its large coffee house.88  
The 
İpshîr Pasha 
coffee house 
consisted of 
a 
courtyard, 
originally centred around a pool, and a hall covered with domes 
forming a cruciform. This courtyard 
resembled 
the 
summer 
reception areas of 
the 
luxurious private homes of Aleppo’s 
wealthier residents in that both were centred around a pool and 
contained an īwān. Likewise, the covered portion of the coffee 
house corresponded to the cruciform domed winter reception 
halls of wealthy urbanites. Moreover, the simple decoration of the 
café courtyard and its īwān and the ornate façade of the covered 
hall also correspond to the decorative traditions associated with 
summer and winter domestic architecture.89 In his study of İpshîr 
Pasha’s waqf, 
Jean-Claude David writes 
that 
‘le café est un 
véritable prolongement de la maison’.90 Thus, again in Aleppo, we 
observe that Ottoman coffee houses and the home were not the 
worlds apart they are often imagined to be. 
Because the male world of the coffee house shared so many 
characteristics traditionally associated with an Ottoman home, we 
might go so far as to assert that ‘the coffee-house is so named with 
reason, instituting a public imitation of a private home’.91 While 
acknowledging the intimate similarities – linguistic, imaginary, 
architectural and otherwise – between the coffee house and the 
home, there is one crucial structural and functional difference 
between the two spaces. As noted earlier, Ottoman mahalles were 
highly protected spaces that allowed only the familiar in and kept 

150 

"
161,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

everything else out. Individual homes were even more highly 
protected spaces, for their interiors and the women and children 
inside 
them were meant never 
to 
be 
seen 
by 
those not 
immediately sanctioned by 
the 
family. People’s houses were 
usually down narrow streets and alleys and did not have much 
traffic going past them.  
Coffee houses, by 
contrast, were 
in 
central 
areas of 
the 
neighbourhood and were usually open structures into which one 
could gaze and out of which one could look. ‘The kahweh [coffee 
house] is, generally speaking, a small apartment, whose front, 
which is towards the street, is of open wooden work, in the form 
of arches.’92 Many café patrons sat outside the built structure of 
the café on the street in full view of passers-by. Peçevi writes that 
during the reign of Sultan Murad III at the end of the sixteenth 
century coffee houses were no longer allowed to spread out onto 
the street. He refers specifically to ‘koltuk kahvesis’ (literally chair 
coffee houses), which presumably blocked 
the 
flow of street 
traffic with their array of chairs, waterpipes and patrons.93 The 
point here is that café patrons could see the street and what was 
going on outside or around their coffee house and that, more 
importantly, people could see into the café. 
The coffee house of the waqf complex of İpshîr Pasha in Aleppo 
again offers us a good example of how Ottoman cafés challenged 
traditional strictures against vision – and specifically against 
seeing interiors – within the city. The İpshîr Pasha coffee house 
opened onto the street rather than towards the interior courtyard 
through a series of windows surrounded by elaborately decorated 
façades. This represents the one break in the seamless exterior 
wall enclosing the complex and, as Watenpaugh asserts, 
‘the 
degree of decoration of the façade correlates with the expected 
degree of interaction [between the street and the interior].’94  
The coffee house was therefore not completely separated from 
the exterior streets beyond the walls of the waqf complex. Indeed, 
it interacted with its outside as those passing by could see into the 
café and patrons of course could look back at them. This visual 
back and forth correspondence between the interior of the café 

151 

"
162,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

and what was outside it made the coffee house in some ways a 
transparent space of performative socialization where patrons had 
always to be aware of who might be looking in from the street.95 
This is of the utmost importance because of all the built spaces in 
the city – mosques, homes, shops, hospitals, soup kitchens and so 
on – the coffee house was one of the few – if not the only – into 
which and out of which one could look. Of course there were 
times when the sides of cafés were closed and their windows 
draped over, but for much of the year most cafés were open to the 
breeze and, more significantly, to the gaze. 
Historic prohibitions against vision within the Muslim city are 
grounded in the Qur’ān and in various Hadīth traditions that 
assure urban residents a high degree of visual privacy.96 For 
instance, one Hadīth instructs that ‘he who pulls the curtain and 
looks into a house before he is granted permission to enter has 
committed an offence.’97 Similarly, we read in the Qur’ān, ‘O ye 
who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until ye have 
asked permission and saluted those in them. … If ye find no one 
in the house, enter not until permission is given to you. … Say to 
the believers that they should lower their gaze and guard their 
modesty.’98 Both 
these quotes stress 
that one must be given 
permission to look into or enter a home that is not one’s own, 
even if the house is empty of inhabitants.  
The 
scholar of 
Islam, Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, 
summarizes 
the 
prohibitions against visual intrusion in Islam by saying that ‘what 
we do not 
see 
should not be probed 
into.’99 The Prophet 
Muhammad 
instructs that 
if a person ever peeps at someone 
without his permission, then the offended party may put out the 
transgressor’s eye without fear of being counted a sinner.100 In 
practice, these proscriptions against uninvited vision 
into the 
home meant that Islamic domestic architecture developed in such 
a way as to eliminate, to as great a degree as possible, all visual 
corridors between the home and what was external to it – other 
homes and the street. 
One of 
the 
fullest and most sustained studies of building 
principles in the Islamic world is the fourteenth-century Tunisian 

152 

"
163,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

Mālikī scholar and master builder Ibn al-Rāmī’s Kitāb al-iclān bi-
āhkām al-bunyān, which 
loosely 
translates 
as The 
book 
for 
communicating building solutions.101 For Muslim jurists like Ibn al-
Rāmī and others, the two most worrying features of the built 
environment were doors and windows. Both Ibn al-Rāmī and 
another Mālikī, Ibn al-Qāsim, instructed that doors were not to be 
constructed across from one another for fear that upon exiting 
one’s home one might be able to see into the domestic space of 
the home opposite if its door were by chance open.102 Ibn al-Rāmī 
though asserted that doors could be constructed across from one 
another as long as the space between them – usually the street – 
was sufficiently wide and the traffic heavy enough so as to hinder 
direct sight lines between the two doors. Ibn al-Rāmī further 
refined his notion of visual penetration through open doorways 
by stating that if a man standing in an open doorway completely 
blocked a visual corridor into the space behind him, then this 
door was deemed 
too small 
for visual penetration, and 
the 
construction of doors opposite it was allowed. Moreover, if a man 
standing near the mouth of the door could not be seen because of 
the lighting conditions or size of the opening, then a doorway 
could also be constructed opposite this door.103 
In addition to doorways, windows, as visual conduits into the 
domestic realm, became the subject of much distress for Muslim 
jurists. Indeed, windows were of particular concern because, as 
Ibn al-Ghammāz, a contemporary of 
Ibn al-Rāmī articulated, 
unlike doors, which were sites of constant movement in and out, 
an individual could sit unseen at a window and gaze at his or her 
neighbour without 
the neighbour 
knowing.104 Upper-storey 
windows were only to be used to let in light and air, and if they 
provided one the opportunity to look into another’s home, they 
were to be closed. To determine the proper height of a window 
from the interior of a structure, Ibn al-Rāmī cites the Caliph 
cUmar Ibn al-Khatt āb who instructs that ‘a bed is to be placed 
underneath the window, and if a man standing on it does not see 
through it, then the window is allowed to remain, otherwise it 
should be shut.’105  

153 

"
164,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

The placement of windows closer to the ground was determined 
by two factors. First, the window was to be high enough so as not 
to allow passers-by on the street the opportunity to look into the 
house. The second stipulation stated that ground-floor windows 
should not allow one to see from the inside of the house into 
another neighbouring residence even if this window is above eye 
level. Similar arguments meant to prevent visual access into the 
home were also made about the construction of balconies and 
roofs. 
Most of these prohibitions were of course meant to prevent 
those outside the home seeing interior spaces in which they might 
catch a glimpse of women and children. Thus, as places where 
only men 
gathered, 
coffee houses 
escaped most 
of 
these 
traditional strictures against vision in the Islamic city, helping 
explain why so many were open structures with 
few visual 
barriers between the inside and outside.  
Furthermore, Ottoman cafés draw our attention to an arguably 
more important urban sensory experience – audition. By this I 
mean that in coffee houses what was most important was not 
what was seen, but what was said and of course what was heard. 
In other words, in neighbourhood cafés, where the clientele was 
made up of mahalle regulars who returned day after day, the 
visual effects of the café eventually became simply background in 
the sense that the familiarity of the place bred a sort of blindness 
to 
its detail, especially since most coffee houses had rather 
unadorned interiors. The place itself and its visual evocations 
became secondary to what went on inside it and specifically to 
what was said in it. Another way to make the same point is to 
remember 
the common proverb 
that 
is still 
found 
in many 
Turkish coffee houses: ‘gönül ne kahve ister ne kahvehane, gönül 
sohbet ister, kahve bahane’ – The heart desires neither coffee nor a 
coffee house. The heart desires conversation. Coffee is simply an 
excuse.  
Significantly, Ibn al-Rāmī instructs that while visual penetration 
of the home was to be guarded against, sound was allowed to 
travel freely and seemingly unchecked within a city’s neighbour-

154 

"
165,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

hoods. Thus, he sanctioned opening a window 
that did not 
overlook a neighbour’s property even though 
it provided 
for 
audible penetration of this space. Likewise, muezzins (those who 
performed the call to prayer) were not allowed to climb minarets 
if their elevated positions provided a direct line of sight into a 
neighbouring home, but 
their voices were sanctioned and of 
course encouraged to enter every space in the home.106 External 
voices or noise were thus allowed into the home but the visual 
gaze was not. Indeed, as Mustafa Âli documents, the city was full 
of unseemly noises: belching, nose-blowing that ‘sounds like a 
horn’, whistling and ‘the indecent sounds made by crude city 
boys’.107 This shift in emphasis from the visual to the audible 
forces us now to grapple with the historically illusive subjects of 
speech, rumour and gossip within the city. 
Before proceeding, 
though, we must deal with a problem 
immediately evoked by conversation and speaking and that is the 
question of hearing. Specifically, what is at issue here is not the 
audible perceptions of café patrons but our ability as historians to 
hear them. In other words, how can we listen to the conversations 
of coffee house men who lived and died hundreds of years ago? A 
different way to ask this question and one that has received much 
attention is Gayatri Spivak’s rendering: ‘can the subaltern speak?’ 
She of course 
famously answers her own question with 
a 
resounding ‘no’, claiming that ‘the subaltern has no history [in 
other words no representation 
in historiography] and cannot 
speak.’108 By 
entreating us 
to 
think 
carefully 
about 
those 
subalterns who have traditionally not received the attention of 
historians interested in political and economic history, Spivak’s 
essay poses numerous challenges to the historian. Yet, in the end, 
she overstates her thesis and thereby precludes any possibility of 
hearing the voices of these subalterns. In her brilliant study of 
prostitution in twentieth-century Shanghai, Gail Hershatter offers 
us an important addendum to Spivak’s arguments: 

If we replace ‘The subaltern cannot speak’ (or, what I take 
to be closer to Spivak’s actual argument, ‘The subaltern 

155 

"
166,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

cannot represent herself 
in discourse’) with 
‘Many sub-
alterns making cacophonous noise, some hogging the mike, 
many 
speaking 
intermittently and not exactly as 
they 
please, and all aware to some degree of the political uses of 
their representation in that historical moment,’ we probably 
have a closer approximation of the situation confronting 
historians. If we are lucky, we also have a way out of the 
‘disappearing subaltern’ impasse, in which any subaltern 
who speaks loses the right to that status. Finally, we have a 
chance to complicate the picture of one overarching dis-
course, in which subalterns appear only as positioned by 
their elite spokespersons.109 

Hershatter’s point is that the subaltern can speak and that the 
historian can hear him. Whether she does or not 
though 
is 
another question entirely. 
One of the most notable recent attempts to hear subaltern 
voices is the work of Cengiz Kırlı on Istanbul coffee houses. 
Through his impressive study of nineteenth-century Ottoman spy 
reports – jurnals as they were known – Kırlı seeks to hear the 
everyday voices of café men to learn about their experiences, their 
concerns, and ultimately about the world in which they lived.110 
Kırlı is, in the final analysis though, unable to hear men’s voices 
because he is listening to them with the ears of the state. Apart 
from one example of a conversation between two men about the 
relative merits of bathing and cleanliness, all of the coffee house 
conversations cited by Kırlı are about what we might crudely term 
political history.111  
For example, one of the most important topics of the day for the 
Ottoman 
state was Muhammad 
cAlī’s 
invasion of Syria and 
Anatolia, and much of the space in the jurnals at this time was 
devoted to this topic. Other issues covered by these reports were 
taxation, state appointments and Ottoman state relations with 
Greek and Armenian communities in the face of conversions and 
European machinations. After a reading of these reports then, we 
come away with the sense that nearly all men’s talk in coffee 

156 

"
167,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

houses was about politics and the economy.112 Of course, as Kırlı 
notes, these were reports by government bureaucrats hired by the 
state to get a sense of the political mood of its subject citizens, 
and it should therefore be no surprise that most of what we get 
from these jurnals is about the politics of the Ottoman state.113 
The problem of hearing and of hearing Ottoman coffee house 
men, though, is not simply one of sources.114 While historians are 
of course limited by their source material, it is instructive here to 
remember that gossip is not rumour. While both are talk about 
others or events not immediately present in one’s field of vision, 
rumour is usually considered to be talk that matters to a political 
entity – idle chatter’s version of realpolitik. Rumour is about the 
world of state politics – a realm in which important men make 
important decisions about war, taxation and so forth. Rumour is 
critical of the establishment, can lead to rebellion and is therefore 
of concern 
to 
those with a vested 
interest 
in upholding 
the 
existing social structure.115  
Al-Jabartī refers to rumour at one point as curiosity, talk and 
clamour (al-fudūl wa al-kalām wa al-laght) that stirs up feelings of 
enmity (mimmā yuhīju al-cadāwa).116 In the Ottoman empire, this 
type of talk was known as devlet sohbeti (state talk) and it became 
an issue worthy of state attention, thus motivating the spy reports 
of the nineteenth century.117 Gossip, on the other hand, was for 
the state far more benign.118 It did not lead to rebellions, regicide 
or strikes. It was talk of the neighbourhood, politically meaning-
less stories about one’s neighbours, or simply the idle babble of 
the masses.119 Mustafa Âli calls this chatter ‘urban affection of 
speech and nonsensical talk, grounded in allusions, ambiguous 
phrases and untruths’.120 As long as there was social stability and 
taxes were being paid on a regular basis, the Ottoman state did 
not care about 
the politics of gossip 
in 
its numerous urban 
mahalles. Why should it become involved in what was considered 
to be the petty bickerings of its subjects?121 
Important also are the truth claims associated with each of the 
two 
categories of 
speech. Rumour 
tends 
to have 
a more 
tendentious relationship with the information it supposedly relays 

157 

"
168,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

than gossip. Rumours are more likely to be lies – what Mustafa 
Âli calls the 
‘snakelike-winding sweet lies that clash with the 
facts’.122 Both types of conversation also imply a level of trust 
between parties and even a degree of friendship. Admittedly, the 
distinction between rumour and gossip is a slippery one for which 
I can offer only tentative interpretative suggestions. In addition to 
the 
terms mentioned above, 
there are a number of ways 
in 
Ottoman Turkish in which to think about rumour and gossip.  
The Ottoman terms used to denote things about which people 
are 
talking 
include 
ishācat, spreading, diffusing or disclosing; 
shā’ica, a rumour or generally-known news; and shā’ic olmak, 
spread or commonly talked about. Other words include namīme, 
which can mean whispering, making mischief or telling tales, but 
also includes ‘the sound of a pen when writing’, suggesting an 
interesting relationship between the spoken words of gossip and 
rumour and their written counterparts.123 The originally Persian 
word lāf for talk, chatter or boasting, gives us the expression lāf ü 
güdhāf, which Redhouse translates as ‘empty words’.124 Şemseddin 
Sami offers the following synonyms for the expression lāf ü güdhāf 
– 
boş 
lāqırdı 
(empty 
conversation 
or, more 
idiomatically, 
nonsense or idle talk) and saçma söz (nonsensical word).125 We 
also have the expression qīl ü qāl. Whereas Redhouse translates 
this as ‘tittle-tattle’,126 the late seventeenth-century lexicographer 
Franciszek Meninski defines 
it as 
‘much conversation’127 or 
‘loquaciousness, garrulity’.128 Şemseddin Sami includes qīl ü qāl 
under his entry for the word dedikodu, the most common word in 
modern Turkish for gossip.129  
The relative differences in usage and understanding of these 
terms are not easily ascertained, but I offer them as examples of 
the type of vocabulary Ottomans used in discussing ideas similar 
to those of rumour and gossip. As with the conceptions of space 
in Ottoman cities mentioned above, ours is largely a problem of 
vocabulary when attempting to express the subtle distinctions 
between rumour and gossip in the Ottoman world. How would 
Ottomans, 
for example, have described rumours about social 
issues, familial life or neighbourhood corruption? What words 

158 

"
169,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

would they have used to describe gossip about the politically 
damaging drinking habits or sexual life of a certain judge? How, 
in short, did Ottomans describe the ways they talked? The point I 
wish to stress here is that historians have been overwhelmingly 
concerned with rumour – precisely because of the state’s engage-
ments with it – rather than gossip. Rumours are, to put it simply, 
much easier for historians to hear than gossip. 
Thus, the jurnals Kırlı studies deal solely with rumour and 
almost completely 
ignore gossip because 
the 
latter was not 
important for the state to hear. In fact, Kırlı does not distinguish 
between gossip and 
rumour, and clearly, 
though 
seemingly 
unwittingly, privileges 
the 
latter as a means of reading state 
power. He writes that ‘rumour and gossip were the most impor-
tant media in Ottoman society.’130 Yet, he more clearly restates his 
opinion with the following: ‘Rumour constituted the single most 
important medium 
in the Ottoman empire. … Its mobilizing 
capacity as a vehicle of dissent made it an object for the state to 
control and suppress. In the eyes of the state its uncontrollable 
nature made it a formidable threat against the social order.’131 
Kırlı’s preference for rumour over gossip as the most significant 
form of communication 
in the Ottoman world 
is I think an 
exaggeration that at best reifies the power of the Ottoman state 
and at worst blinds us to the realities of Ottoman life. 
In other words, I think we can say with some confidence that 
most conversations 
in Ottoman coffee houses were not about 
Muhammad cAlī or the conversions of Armenians to Islam. They 
were about men’s families, their problems at work, troubles with 
their children, a new purchase, gossip about their neighbours or 
about their hopes 
for the 
future.132 Indeed, scholars of gossip 
describe 
the dialectical nature of 
this performative mode of 
expression as a constant 
tension between 
the social need 
to 
maintain friendship networks and the ideals of familial privacy.133 
Thus the everyday conversations of cafés were precisely about the 
everyday lives of men, not the political goings-on of the Topkapi 
Palace or elsewhere. 
In 
the words of one nineteenth-century 
European traveller to Istanbul, coffee houses were ‘the headquarters 

159 

"
170,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

of gossipry, and news, and enjoyment’ where ‘time is suffered to 
slide by as carelessly as though it might one day be redeemed’.134  
Mustafa Âli describes coffee house conversations as ‘nonsensical 
speech’ filled with gossip, backbiting and slander.135 Elsewhere, 
he terms the men frequenting coffee houses ‘captives of com-
panionship … who love to sit and talk with their friends for hours 
on end’.136 To assume that what café patrons talked most about 
were the political intrigues we find in jurnals is to short-change 
the experiences of these men as those of purely enlightened 
political actors. Moreover, it gives I believe an incorrect view of 
the coffee house as a completely public realm devoted to the 
affairs of state – a kind of 
local 
imperial divan dedicated to 
political debate. 
To move beyond accounts like Kırlı’s, which depict the café as 
the male public institution of rumour and political intrigue, we 
must acknowledge, as noted above, that the Ottoman coffee house 
was not, as Habermas suggests, the paradigmatic institution of the 
bourgeoisie’s public 
sphere. Again, 
the distinction between 
‘public’ and ‘private’ – and the corollary dichotomy of ‘male’ and 
‘female’ – are a hindrance in thinking about Ottoman neighbour-
hoods and their coffee houses.  
Instead 
of 
looking 
for divisions, we 
should 
– 
recalling 
Foucault’s notion of the heterotopia – stress the idea of multi-
layered or overlapping spaces within the city where different 
places were constantly infused with fluidly changing meanings. 
Certain homes, for instance, functioned as spaces of communal, 
quasi-public gathering 
for groups of poor women who were 
unable to afford separate haremliks in their own houses. Likewise, 
the neighbourhood sometimes took on an interior character by 
virtue of women who did domestic and familial chores in spaces 
outside 
the physical structures of 
their homes, 
thereby sym-
bolically transforming ‘public’ spaces like the street into ‘private’ 
spaces.137 As noted above, the coffee house was just such a space 
because it offered its patrons a physical space similar to that of the 
home, complete with divan and kitchen, yet in the setting of the 
neighbourhood and the street.  

160 

"
171,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

The 
seventeenth-century Ottoman 
state historian Mustafa 
Naima, writing about ‘a crowd of good-for-nothings’, spoke in the 
same breath of their meetings in coffee houses, barber shops and 
private homes, thus indicating the rotation and overlap of these 
three places as spaces of gathering.138 Because 
the café was 
convivial and offered men a chance to be with their peers and 
friends, it functioned as a kind of selamlık for the poorer men of 
Ottoman cities. Moreover, what Richard Sennett terms ‘the mark 
of friendship’, created an environment in the café conducive to 
feelings of comfort, camaraderie and trust.139 The coffee house 
was thus an institution outside the home that offered men many 
of the same comforts traditionally associated with that domestic 
space. 
The focus on the multiplicity of coffee-house functions and 
affects is not only about space but also about gender. Whereas 
the world of coffee houses, devlet sohbeti, rumour and politics 
has 
traditionally been portrayed as 
the domestic realm, 
the 
home has been gendered female as a place of innocuous gossip 
and chatter. Dina Khoury provides an example of the female 
gendering of gossip with reference to the 
following popular 
Mosuli proverb. ‘If I tell my neighbor [the female jāra], the 
neighbor will tell another neighbor [again the female jāra], and 
if I keep it in my heart, my gallbladder will explode.’140 Thus, at 
least in the Mosuli popular imagination, gossip seems to be the 
domain of females. Important also is that the female gossipers 
are neighbours. This points to the spatialized imagining of the 
neighbourhood as a place where, like a lingering smell, gossip 
wafted in and out of homes, out onto the street and through the 
minds of mahalle residents. 
If, as this Mosuli proverb suggests, gossip was the business of 
women, how then do we account for the fact that Mustafa Âli and 
other writers make it clear that coffee houses allowed men the 
space to wile away their hours in idle gossip and chatter? For 
example, Charles White relates that coffee house regulars would 
‘curl up their legs, and remain in listless enjoyment from one 
prayer hour 
to another’, adding 
that 
‘here 
the gossips and 

161 

"
172,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

quidnuncs of the quarter assemble to discuss private as well as 
public affairs.’141 For the English case, one scholar suggests that 
‘the coffee-house transformation of manners renders its public 
space a more private and sentimental arena (the “home” or 
“neighbourhood”). The 
structural privatization of 
the public 
sphere 
into 
the division of 
the “neighbourhood” 
is managed 
according 
to a model celebrating values associated with and 
derived from the construction of femininity.’142  
Another commentator goes so far as to say that the coffee house 
‘ushers private, “feminine”, practices into the public domain.’143 
The overlapping senses of meaning expressed in the space of the 
Ottoman coffee house show us that dichotomies of female/male, 
masculine/feminine, 
and 
public/private 
in 
their 
traditional 
Habermasian senses with all their social and political associations 
are inadequate conceptual tools with which to analyse Ottoman 
cities. By getting past these conflations of ‘the public’ with men 
and 
‘the private’ with women, 
I 
think we come 
to a 
fuller 
understanding of Ottoman neighbourhood life where what was 
meant by 
‘male’ and 
‘female’ and 
‘public’ and 
‘private’ was 
constantly changing and flowing between the home, the coffee 
house and the neighbourhood. 
To 
interrogate further this relationship between gender and 
coffee houses 
in the Ottoman world, 
it proves 
instructive to 
explore the genderings of coffee itself in this social milieu. An 
initial question then is, did coffee have a gender in the Ottoman 
world? The Arabic word 
for coffee, qahwa, 
from which 
the 
Turkish word kahve is derived, is feminine. Alan Kaye surmises 
that 
‘since khamr “wine” 
is 
feminine, qahwah [feminine] was 
chosen over 
the hypothetical masculine counterpart qahw.’144 
Kaye’s explanation relies on the early association of coffee with 
wine as both were thought to lessen one’s appetite for food.145  
Thus, at the level of language we observe a latent association 
between 
coffee 
and 
the 
feminine. Moreover, Katip Çelebi 
associates coffee with those of ‘moist temperament’, by which he 
means women. He writes, ‘especially to women, it is highly suited. 
They should drink a great deal of strong coffee. Excess of it will 

162 

"
173,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

do them no harm, so long as they are not melancholic.’146 More 
importantly, in Ottoman homes preparing and serving coffee was 
considered to be the responsibility of women. They drank 
it 
themselves in the haremlik and gave it to their guests. Wealthier 
families 
employed women whose 
sole 
function was 
the 
preparation of coffee for the household, and in these upper-class 
homes, ‘a curious old custom, still observed, requires that while 
the coffee is served all the slaves and attendants shall enter the 
room and stand at one end with folded arms.’  
Coffee also played an intimate role in betrothal and marriage 
customs. According to one European travel account, a prospective 
bride’s ability to make good coffee was an important factor in 
weighing the relative merits of the woman as a future wife. Coffee 
also functioned as the warm and familiar mediator between the 
bride and her bridegroom during 
their 
first moments alone 
together.147 All this suggests that coffee was 
indeed gendered 
female in the Ottoman world. It was associated with the domestic 
labour of women and came to be a sign of female hospitality 
within the home. Thus, we could read the coffee house as an 
extension of the feminine (in the form of coffee) into the public 
sphere in the same way that women’s domestic chores were often 
performed outside the physical confines of the home. 
This 
female gendering of coffee becomes significantly more 
complicated when one turns to Ottoman poetry.148 As I have been 
arguing 
throughout, coffee houses are 
important sites 
in 
the 
Ottoman world precisely because they complicated and confused 
our traditional notions of space and gender. To understand the 
meanings of coffee and gender in Ottoman poetry, we must first 
examine the role of wine in the Ottoman poetical tradition.149 
Since its beginnings in the Muslim world, coffee was considered 
to be a close associate of wine. Before coffee houses, coffee 
drinkers enjoyed their beverage in wine taverns.150 Moreover, the 
effects of coffee were thought to be similar to those of wine, for 
both impaired judgement, made the blood race and stimulated the 
mind and heart. Take for instance Mustafa Âli’s description of the 
similar physiological effects of wine and coffee: ‘the bitter drink of 

163 

"
174,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

tenebrous temperament which they call “coffee” is exceptional in 
that it cuts off sleep and lust. Over indulgence in it certainly leads 
to the affliction of excessive passing of urine. The same applies to 
the best of the bunch, red wine.’151 
In Ottoman poetical traditions, wine often comes to symbolize 
love 
or 
the 
beloved.152 Consider 
the 
following 
from 
the 
eighteenth-century poet Nedim: ‘at the gathering of desire you 
made me a wine-cup with your sugar smile.’153 Figani, a sixteenth-
century poet, muses 
‘my tears mirror your lip, red as blood-
coloured 
wine.’154 While 
wine-inspired 
imagery 
infuses 
descriptions of the beloved, we should not too quickly assume 
that 
the beloved 
is a woman. 
Indeed, more often 
than not 
precisely the opposite is the case. With regards to Ottoman Arabic 
poetry, Khaled El-Rouayheb writes that ‘it is illegitimate, in light 
of the predominance of masculine word-forms in love-poetry and 
the frequency of gender-markers indicating that the portrayed 
beloved was male, to assume without further ado that the Arabic 
love-poetry of the period usually portrayed a woman.’155  
In our present context, the usual referent in this type of poetry 
is the male saki (wine server). Ottoman wine parties took place in 
gardens and were usually all male affairs among friends in which 
male sakis and other servants were on hand.156 Thus, we read, 
‘The wine party is a rose-garden in which the saki is the garden 
watchman/The curl of the beloved on her cheek is the garden 
watchman of the garden of paradise.’157 In a similar vein, the 
eighteenth-century poet Sheyh Galib writes, ‘Oh Saki, you filled 
my cup with tears of blood, it glows scarlet like the dawn/On the 
morning after the wine-party, if I’m still drunk, it is because of 
you.’158 In sum, then, the tradition of Ottoman lyrical poetry 
identifies wine as a suitable symbol of the beloved, who is usually 
the young male saki. 
A poem written during the reign of Süleyman helps us to see 
how these images of wine and the beloved changed once coffee 
came to replace wine as the most important social beverage in the 
Ottoman empire. The poet Beligi recites that: 

164 

"
175,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

The qualities of coffee are not like those of rosy wine 
But that black-faced one’s blood will warm a person 
Does it have a like or equal in heating up its customer 
When its face it seen all heated up, everyone wants it. … 

It travelled through Egypt, Damascus, Aleppo on its way to Turkey 
That disruptor of the world, took the cup/power159 from wine 
He is attracted to money, he walks around and collects akçes 
I don’t know if he’s a whore, that coffee house owner’s boy.160 

This poem is useful for numerous reasons. First, it refers to the 
history of coffee and specifically to its importation from Egypt 
through Syria and into Turkey. More importantly, Beligi’s poem 
mentions that coffee, ‘that disruptor of the world’, replaced wine 
as the important drink in Ottoman life. This phrase ‘disruptor of 
the world’ (cihan fettanı) attaches great significance to the advent 
of coffee in the Ottoman world and suggests not only coffee’s 
importance but also its character as a temptation or source of evil 
since fettan can refer to one who habitually tempts another, to 
Satan, or to a fiendishly flirtatious courtier.  
This line – the sixth of the poem – is also important because of 
the idiomatic expression ayak almak, which has a double meaning 
in this context. Ayak means both foot and cup and almak simply 
means to take. Thus the expression could be translated literally as 
‘to take the foot’, which idiomatically translates as ‘to undercut’ or 
‘to take the prestige or power of’. One meaning of the line then is 
that coffee appeared suddenly to displace the importance of wine. 
Alternatively, 
if we take ayak to mean cup, then the phrase 
suggests that the cup was physically taken away from wine to be 
filled with coffee. On this same point, the poet Sani writes, ‘The 
jugs are broken, the goblet empty, wine is no more/You’ve made 
us prisoners of coffee, alas destiny alas.’161 
In terms of the importance of this poem for what it tells us 
about gender and its relationship to coffee, two points stand out. 
First, coffee is personified in the poem through the image of 
bleeding, a trope also used in describing wine (as ‘tears of blood’ 

165 

"
176,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

for instance).162 Thus the literal ‘bleeding’ of the coffee bean as it 
transforms into a liquid evokes images similar to those used when 
describing wine: 
the beloved’s 
‘blood-coloured’ 
lips or 
the 
pumping 
of 
the 
blood 
as 
the 
heart 
races with 
passion. 
Furthermore, the notion of ‘heating up its customer’ suggests both 
a literal and an erotic meaning. The following line – line four – 
about the heated face again plays a double function: the heating of 
coffee and the warm rosy cheeks of the beloved.  
Mustafa Âli uses similar language to describe guests at wine 
parties as their heads heat up and soften with the 
‘flames of 
fire’.163 Another related issue of importance raised by this and 
other poems is the symbolism of roasting or carbonization. Often 
we read that the heart of the melancholic lover burns to the point 
of blackness.164 Figani for example in a poem cited earlier writes 
that ‘my sad heart is burnt black in the fire of my breast.’165  
This link between carbonization and the sorrow of unrecip-
rocated love should also inform our reading of Beligi’s poem 
about coffee and its cooking. ‘When its face it seen all heated up, 
everyone wants it,’ but perhaps if heated too much to the point of 
roasting, the fire will overwhelm the prospective lover leaving his 
heart 
burnt 
black. We 
should 
also 
remember 
that 
the 
carbonization of coffee was one of the reasons given by religious 
jurists 
for why 
coffee was 
considered 
illegal 
and 
therefore 
forbidden. Katip Çelebi refers 
to 
fatwas promulgated against 
coffee for this very reason.166  
Peçevi also notes official religious opposition to coffee because 
of its carbonization, but he writes that once coffee and cafés 
became sufficiently popular 
to be beyond 
the point of any 
possible 
prohibition, 
religious 
officials 
then 
changed 
their 
decision claiming 
that coffee did not actually get completely 
carbonized. Coffee, they asserted, was therefore legal and Peçevi 
tells us that from among the ulama, sheikhs, viziers and the 
important members of society there was not one of them that did 
not drink coffee.167 Thus, along with symbolizing the burning 
pain of unrequited love, carbonization and burning also had an 
air of illegality attached to them. 

166 

"
177,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

The second point to be made here is about the issue of the 
coffee house boy and his representation in Beligi’s poem. It was 
suggested that these boys be allowed only to drink ‘simple coffee’ 
– or coffee with no narcotic additives.168 The genealogy of this 
position of course harkens back to the role of the saki in garden 
wine parties, and the notion of the café boy as an object of 
affection 
or 
desire 
is 
one 
commented 
on 
by 
numerous 
observers.169 Whether or not the coffee house boy was indeed a 
‘whore’ (kahbe) with whom one could have sexual relations or 
merely an attractive boy is not immediately clear from the poem 
itself. As noted earlier, we do know though that these beardless 
boys were objects of sexual desire for Ottoman men, and we often 
read of women and these beardless lads in the same breath as 
equally suitable sexual objects. In the words of two scholars of 
Ottoman poetry, Walter Andrews and Mehmed Kalpaklı:  

The beloved is most often male – a young male – and 
constitutes an ideal of male beauty. Where female beloveds 
are intended, or where a poem is addressed to a female, 
there is little, if any, gendered difference in the description 
of the looks or behaviour of the beloved. … It is important 
to remember as well that the beloved of the poetry 
is 
ambiguous, androgynous. … Our topic is a love that does 
not 
distinguish 
the 
gender 
of 
the 
beloved 
in 
any 
meaningful way.170 

On the specific topic of beardless boys, Everett Rowson explains 
that ‘the canons for beauty of boys are virtually the same as those 
for women, a fact underlined by the extraordinary prominence of 
the question of the beard in homoerotic poetry and anecdote. … 
Like women, boys lacked both beards and power, and that they 
should be assimilated to them as objects of sexual desire as well is 
hardly surprising.’171 By way of example, Mustafa Âli states in the 
sixteenth century that ‘the beautiful servant girls and boys … are 
usually mentioned as a pair like the houris and male servants of 
paradise.’172  

167

Later, he describes the troops of a certain rebel army doing ‘as 
they please with beardless boys, and 
the most beautiful and 
attractive girls, kissing and caressing them’.173 Similarly, 
‘hot-
blooded young men’ are ‘fond of drinking and fornicating with 
women and boys’.174 Âli condemns any sexual relations between 
men and boys terming it ‘reprehensible to fondle and grope these 
boys’ and instructing – in telling language – that beardless lads 
should not be used 
‘as a 
female animal’.175 Âli’s 
injunctions, 
however, made no impact on Ottoman men’s sexual wants. He 
does, nevertheless, go to the trouble of documenting the sexual 
scheduling required by this Ottoman male desire for both women 
and boys. Thursday night was reserved for sexual relations with 
women, Friday night for young men and Friday afternoon for 
servant boys and beardless youths.176 
As shown above, Ottoman learned men most often desired these 
beardless boys more than they did women. Âli complains that 
‘nowadays there are more dishonorable men who prefer beardless, 
smooth-cheeked, handsome, and sweet tempered servant boys 
than there are men who prefer pretty and charming women.’177  
To explain this phenomenon, Âli suggests that Ottoman men 
desired boys more than women because women were far too often 
out of sight, protected by 
the walls of 
their homes. 
It was 
impossible he said to develop 
friendships with women. Con-
versely, a man could travel openly with a boy and be alone with 
him 
in the home to develop a meaningful relationship. Âli’s 
complaints thus rest on issues of space, privacy and the home. 
Since women were at home and difficult to meet and boys were in 
the market, café and at home, the 
latter were more suitable 
companions and friends with whom relations would not seem 
improper and were more easily established. Coffee-house boys 
thus again show us how the café challenges and makes more 
complex traditional understandings of space and gender within 
the city. 
Moreover, 
the association of coffee with 
the complicatedly 
gendered constructions of 
these young boys, as well as 
its 
symbolic link with love and sorrow, help us understand how 

168 

"
179,"GENDER, URBAN SPACE AND THE OTTOMAN COFFEE HOUSE 

gender in the Ottoman world was a complex and constantly-
negotiated terrain. Again, as Andrews and Kalpaklı state, insofar 
as the erotic was concerned ‘the (elite) male imagination made no 
practical distinction between boys and girls/ women. The genders 
blend one into the other. Each one can act the part of the other in 
an erotic script. Anyone who can be dominated and penetrated 
can be the object of sexual desire.’178 Thus, within the gendered 
power relations of coffee houses, beardless boys – like women – 
were certainly in positions of weakness as the penetrated objects 
of men’s desire.  
We should take care though not to extrapolate this point too far 
because, ‘despite the asymmetry between the sexes symbolized by 
penetration, neither male nor 
female homosexual 
interest or 
behaviour carries any 
implications 
for general conceptions of 
gender.’179 Nevertheless, coffee houses, as sites of both coffee – 
with all its symbolic evocations of the heart and the lover – and 
coffee-house boys, force us to think of gender in the Ottoman 
world as a complicated 
layering of ambiences, 
identities and 
desires 
– 
a 
kind 
of 
gender-heterotopia. 
In 
the Ottoman 
imagination, the coffee house – like gardens where so many wine 
parties occurred – is ‘a special kind of space, one where the rules 
of normal (public) space do not apply’.180 
Moreover, these beardless boys also challenge our ideas of the 
home and the domestic as exclusive realms of the female, for 
these lads were not only gendered female but also described in 
terms 
that 
lauded 
their 
domestic 
skills. Commenting 
on 
Abyssinian boys, Âli writes that 
‘if it gets cold in the house, 
they’re everyone’s sable fur. One hears that they are especially 
proficient at taking care of beds – that they adore perfuming the 
bedclothes with 
incense and 
fluffing up and arranging 
the 
mattresses and pillows.’181 Thus, here the young boy is extolled 
for his domestic and sexual capabilities and praised as an integral 
part of the household.182 Thus, 
if beardless boys disrupt our 
notions of the Ottoman café as an all-male space where the female 
did not exist, then they also challenge ideas of the home and the 
domestic as exclusively feminine zones.

180,"OTTOMAN TULIPS, OTTOMAN COFFEE 

Coffee in the Ottoman world was a material substance infused 
with various social, religious, cultural, political, medical and 
economic meanings. For some, 
it was a religiously forbidden 
drink that could adversely affect the body, soul and mind of its 
imbiber. Others saw in coffee an opportunity for financial gain 
through 
trade 
or 
coffee-house proprietorship.183 The 
social 
manifestation of coffee 
in the Ottoman world was the coffee 
house and these institutions, like the drink itself, aroused all 
kinds of competing emotions and opinions.  
My concern here has been to evaluate notions of gender and 
space 
in Ottoman 
cities 
through 
an 
examination of urban 
neighbourhood cafés. These spaces I believe force us to reassess 
how we 
think about Ottoman cities and show how simple 
distinctions between spaces 
termed 
‘public’ and 
‘private’ and 
between notions of ‘male’ and ‘female’ are inadequate analytical 
tools. Ottoman cities were complex places in which gradations of 
gender and space constantly shifted. Within 
this continually 
changing environment, moreover, coffee houses – along with 
places like public baths and barber shops – existed as heterotopias 
of overlapping functions and multiple identities.184 Neither cities 
nor coffee houses can possibly be understood using 
simple 
dichotomies, and to think otherwise is to remain deaf to the 
Ottoman mahalle coffee house.

This chapter has received more kind attention than it deserves. For 
their meticulous readings and extensive comments on an earlier version 
of it, I extend my profound gratitude to Ilham-Khuri Makdisi, Shirine 
Hamadeh, Mohammed Waked, Farish Noor, Alan Mikhail, Orlin Sabev 
and Dyala Hamzah. I have also benefited greatly from a lively dis-
cussion with colleagues at the Zentrum Moderner Orient, Berlin, where 
I presented some of the ideas herein. I am also grateful to Shahab 
Ahmed, who has extended the accustomed encouragement and editorial 
assistance. This could not have been written without the indispensable 
help of Rehan Ali, who kindly provided materials that were unavailable 
to me at the time.

I should make it clear at the outset that this introduction does not 
aspire to be a survey (for which one for the eighteenth century 
already exists). Neither does it purport to be comprehensive in its 
treatment of anti-decline, for the majority of works produced in the 
past quarter-century have been written in that vein, making the task 
impossible and imposing selectivity. Last but not least, while it would 
be instructive to compare the output of the different national and 
regional academies, for reasons of space this will be devoted mostly 
to production 
in 
the English 
language. For 
the aforementioned

of the Damascene Sufi and scholar cAbd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī. Her 
study 
reveals 
that much of al-Nābulusī’s polemics constituted an 
engagement with the Kadızadeli movement. See Barbara Rosenow-von

85. While I was writing this, a number of senior colleagues sent postings on 
one of the professional electronic mail lists to express their frustration 
at working with educational documentary 
film productions on the 
Ottoman empire. No matter how much these scholars have tried to 
influence content and approach, the films have invariably portrayed the 
Ottoman empire in the post-sixteenth century as one in decline. About 
a recent history channel production entitled ‘The Ottoman Empire: the 
war machine’ in which he participated, Donald Quataert commented, 
‘the presentation of these centuries of decline included film makers’ 
statements about the Ottomans’ lack of an economy, political order and 
culture, not to mention the absence of any social formation.’ Message

suggested an intra-Ottoman interpretation of Saadabad, as well as a 
possible link up between the construction of Saadabad in Istanbul and 
Ahmed III’s political and military programmes in Iran. Rather than 
looking 
for external sources 
for 
the architectural configuration of 
Damad İbrahim’s Kâğıthane project, I suggested a parallel with the 
architectural 
and wider 
cultural patronage of Ahmed 
III’s 
father 
Mehmed 
IV (1648–87)

Liman von Sanders pointed out that his charge had not been a politi-

been drawn up the previous November. He was to occupy this post

greater interest in the interactions of these two Islamic rivals. A. Y.

Sultan Beyazid II (1481–1512) pursued a policy of appeasement towards 
Shah Ismacil and the Safavid threat to the Ottoman state. Once, şehzâde 
[prince] Selim forcibly occupied the throne on 7 Safer 918/24 April 1512, 
however, he immediately initiated a strict policy to suppress the threat to 
the central authority posed by an elaborate network of Safavid agents 
active inside the Ottoman dominions. In pursuing these goals Selim the

Early eighteenth-century Ottomans appear to have possessed a strong 
historical consciousness. İbrahim Müteferrika even proceeded to print 
an Ottoman translation of an Arabic biography of Timur, written by 
Ahmad Ibn Arabshah (791–854/1392–1450) on Gurre-i Zilkade 1142 
(18 May 1730). Arabshah’s book Aja’ib al-Maqdar received the Ottoman 
title Tarih-i Timûr Gürkân (cf. Kut and Türe, Yazmadan Basmaya, p. 
45). 
It seems ironic that Damad İbrahim and Ahmed III ensured that the 
Ottoman Saadabad contained apparently readily intelligible references 
to Safavid Isfahan, yet concerning the issue of the Ottoman ‘decorative 
skin’ (borrowing Necipoğlu’s phrase), they seem to have been equally 
determined to separate the Ottoman from the Timurid 
idiom, still 
employed by the Safavids.

expansion of world market networking on the Ottoman economy. See

As Max Weber described it, state building hinges mainly on the pro-
cess by which states can monopolize the means of violence or ‘the 
monopoly of 
the 
legitimate use of physical 
force within a given 
territory.’ Max Weber, ‘Politics as vocation’, in From Max Weber: Essays 
in Sociology, edited and translated by H. H. Gerth and C. W. Mills 
(London, Routledge, 1991) p. 78. 
As a territorial state expands, 
its monopolization of coercion and 
centralization of institutions grows and it becomes increasingly able to 
deprive (semi) autonomous subgroups of the right to maintain power. 
It is at this crucial stage that non-state forms of violence in terms of 
warfare are considered ‘illegitimate’ and ‘criminal’ with the growing 
centralization of the state. See C. Tilly, ‘War making and state making 
as organized crime’, in P. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer and T. Skocpol

This ‘radical change’ actually took place in the course of two centuries 
under Safavid rule. The processional dimension echoes Calmard and 
Chelkowski’s point that the Safavid Muharram ceremonies were a form 
of political patriotic events. It was in the political pomp and the official 
glamour of the ceremonies that the rituals transcended the quality of 
mere

‘devotionalism’. See Peter

l’apogée de la ville ottomane sous Abd al-Rahman Kathuda (Paris: Centre 
National de la Recherche Scientifique Editions, 1995). Works that briefly 
mention Janissary coffee houses are, Işın, ‘More than a beverage’, pp. 33–
5; Kırlı, ‘The struggle over space’, pp. 112–30, Kırlı, ‘İstanbul’, p. 76; 
Kırlı, 
‘Kahvehaneler ve Hafiyeler’, pp. 67–8; Reşad Ekrem Koçu, 
Yeniçeriler (Istanbul: Koçu Yayınları, 1964) pp. 296–9; and Yaşar, ‘The 
coffeehouses in early modern Istanbul’, pp. 61–7. 
Based on statistics provided by Kırlı in his work on early nineteenth-
century coffee shops, we know that one out of every seven or eight 
shops in Istanbul was a coffee house. The great majority of the coffee 
houses, most of which were small enterprises, were run by Muslims. 
One Muslim trader out of four ran a coffee house, and a significant 
number of the Muslims who ran coffee houses were related to the 
Janissary corps. See Kırlı, ‘İstanbul’, pp. 75–6. For this ‘overwhelming 
presence of the janissaries in coffee house business’, see also Kırlı’s 
‘The struggle over space’, 112ff. 
For 
instance, during 
the reigns of Mehmed II and Süleyman 
the 
Magnificient the number of Janissaries are estimated to have been 
between 12,000 and 14,000 (Encyclopedia of Islam, s.v. ‘Yeni Çeri’). 
See for example Gerhard Schwartz, Die Janitscharen: geheime Macht des 
Türkenreichs (Vienna: Amelthea, 1990). 
The formation of 196 ortas goes back to the late fifteenth century.

ı Sânî), 2 vols with consecutive pagination edited by Mehmed Ali 
Beyhan (Ankara: Türk Tarih Kurumu, 2003) vol. 1, pp. 197, 239. 
The term ‘esnafization’ of the Janissary appears in Kafadar, ‘Yeniçeri-
esnaf relations’, p. 82. On Janissary-esnaf connections, see also Olson, 
‘The esnaf and the Patrona Halil rebellion’, pp. 329–44; and Olson, 
‘Jews, Janissaries, esnaf and the revolt of 1740 
in Istanbul: social 
upheaval and political realignment in the Ottoman Empire’, Journal of 
the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 20, 1977, pp. 185–207. 
Originally one orta consisted of 60–70 soldiers. Later, in the middle of 
the eighteenth century the number of Janissaries in an orta began to 
inflate up to 200 and even 300 people. The total number of Janissaries 
rose to 45,000 in the reign of Mehmed III, 110,000 during Selim III, 
and 140,000 during Mahmud II. These figures are for the Janissaries 
who received salaries from the treasury and wielded arms. As well as 
the main salary books for the current members of the Janissary, there 
were also 
salary books 
for 
those 
retired, who 
received pensions 
according to their seniority and service at the corps. So when we 
include the retired, the number of Janissaries at the last period is 
around 200,000. After the devşirme law was abolished and the corps 

199 

"
210,"NOTES FOR CHAPTER 5 

9. 

was opened to the public, a new registry for Janissary aspirants was 
established. However, the 
latter received a salary only when they 
entered the corps to fill the recently vacant positions. In addition, 
many people were registered unlawfully or improperly but received 
salaries. See Abdi Efendi, 1730 Patrona İhtilâli Hakkında Bir Eser: Abdi 
Tarihi, edited by Faik Reşit Unat (Ankara: Türk Tarih Kurumu, 1943), 
p. 43 (henceforth Abdi Efendi, Abdi Tarihi). 
Dünden Bugüne İstanbul Ansiklopedisi, s.v. 
‘Kahvehaneler’; and Kırlı, 
‘İstanbul’, p. 76. According to Işın, ‘at the outset, these establishments 
were 
similar 
to guild coffeehouses with 
the exception 
that 
their 
clientele were drawn 
from 
the members of a particular 
Janissary 
regiment. … Eventually, however, they turned into dives run under the 
supervision of the Janissaries who policed Istanbul’s streets.’ Işın, ‘More 
than a beverage’, p. 33.

perspective’, in Metin Heper and Ahmed Evin (eds) State, Democracy 
and the Military: Turkey in the 1980s (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988) 
p. 32. The following striking example too seems to justify this view. 
‘The register reveals that guilds in early nineteenth century Istanbul 
tended to elect their stewards from among Muslims, and particularly 
Janissaries, to have a better voice in their dealings with the state. For 
example, 
the 
steward of gardeners, Ömer beşe was apparently a 
Janissary, although 95 per cent of 
the gardeners were Orthodox 
Christians’ (Kırlı, ‘The struggle over space’, pp. 117–18). 
12. Material and moral degeneration of the corps and unruly and inefficient 
Janissaries 
in a way brought the end to the corps. The historian, 
Şanizade writes that some corrupt so-called Janissaries in the city were 
so involved in criminal activities and intimidation that even the esnaf, 
who had formerly supported some Janissary uprisings, began to turn 
against them. Those activities included usurpation, kidnapping, receiv-
ing ransom, rape and sexual harassment. See Atâullah Şânîzâde, Târîh-i 
Şânîzâde (4 vols, Istanbul: various publishers, 1284–99/1867–75) vol. 
1, p. 217 ff. 
13. Military reforms, which were crucial for the empire, were rejected and 
prevented by the Janissaries who not only refused any suggestion of 
reform even to adapt to modern military technologies and education, 
but also hindered the formation of forces meeting modern needs. Thus, 
Selim III’s Nizâm-ı Cedîd and Alemdar Mustafa Paşa’s Sekbân-ı Cedîd 
were abolished by two bloody Janissary uprisings in 1807 and 1808 
respectively. The 
Janissaries resisted, since 
their very positions 
in 
Ottoman society as well as that of their supporters among the ruling 

200 

"

NOTES FOR CHAPTER 5  

classes and segments of society in Istanbul depended on old monopolies 
that such reforms would have broken. For a narration and evaluation of 
the Nizâm-ı Cedîd experience, see for instance, Stanford S. Shaw, ‘The 
origins of Ottoman military reform: the Nizam-ı Cedid army of Sultan 
Selim III’, The Journal of Modern History, 37 (3) 1965, pp. 291–306. 
Before proceeding, a word on a problem with our sources is necessary: 
a lot of information on Janissaries and their coffee houses in the late 
period is found in chronicles written by the official historians. These 
works clearly display the distortions that one may expect from the 
official viewpoint and deserve our caution and scepticism. Even the 
language used by most of 
the 
chroniclers 
in 
characterizing 
the 
Janissaries show them to be enemies of both the state and the people. 
For 
instance, Mehmed Escad Efendi’s work Üss-i Zafer 
(Istanbul: 
Matbaa-i Süleyman Efendi, 1293/1876–77), which treats the abolition 
of the Janissary corps, celebrates the event and describes the Janissaries 
as ‘traitors’ and ‘infidels’. (There is also a recent edition of this work, 
Üss-i Zafer: Yeniçeriliğin Kaldırılmasına Dair edited and transcribed into 
modern Turkish by Mehmed Arslan (Istanbul: Kitabevi, 2005), vol. 58, 
230 pp.) Clearly, Escad Efendi’s ambition to become Şeyhülislam, and 
his rapid rise in the bureaucracy following the dismantling of the corps, 
which he actively supported, 
is connected 
to his bias against 
the 
institution. See the editor’s introductory notes in ‘Sahhâflar Şeyhi-zâde 
Seyyid Mehmed Escad Efendi’, Vakcanüvîs Escad Efendi Tarihi, edited by 
Ziya Yılmazer (Istanbul: Osmanu Araştırmaları Vakfi, 2000), pp. 85–6 
and 89 (henceforth, Escad Efendi’, Escad Efendi Tarihi). However, we are 
fortunate to have two accounts that are relatively less hostile to the 
Janissaries. Şanizade’s Târîh-i Şânîzâde 
is overall more balanced 
in 
content and language. It is notable, however, that the author himself 
became a victim of the events he was narrating: during the incident of 
the corps he was charged with being a Bektashi, removed from his post 
and 
sent 
into 
exile. See, Mehmed Dâniş Bey’s Netîcetü’l-Vekayic, 
published under the title Yeniçeri Ocağının Kaldırılışı ve II. Mahmud’un 
Edirne Seyahati: Mehmet Dâniş Bey ve Eserleri, edited by Şamil Mutlu 
(Istanbul: Edebiyat Fakültesi Basımevi, 1994) p. 74 (henceforth Dâniş 
Bey, Netîcetü’l-Vekayic). The second less hostile account is that of Câbî 
Ömer Efendi, who was a tax collector (câbî) for a public endowment in 
Istanbul. Unlike the official histories of his era, Câbî provides vast 
materials absent elsewhere. Although the author had friends in the 
bureaucracy from whom he obtained copies of some official documents 
for his history, he 
is hardly worried about presenting 
the official 
viewpoint. Actually, the concern with Câbî’s history is the opposite: he 
includes oral narratives from ordinary people in coffee houses and in 
the marketplace, which may reflect rumors and popular conceptions 

201 

"
212,"NOTES FOR CHAPTER 5 

and views; however, I have made extensive use of this source, not only 
to counterbalance the sources mentioned above, but for Câbî Târihi’s 
intrinsic value, which provides rich material on life in the city as well as 
physical descriptions of dwellings. 
15. Kırlı (‘İstanbul’, p. 75) mentions that many Janissary cafés were small, 
yet we know from other sources that some were rather big enterprises 
and brought high incomes to their owners. Here perhaps one should 
differentiate two types of Janissary coffee houses: the larger ones owned 
or run by active Janissaries from the corps with high ranks, and the 
other, smaller 
types, run by 
traders who were affiliated with 
the 
Janissary corps. Here, I shall focus on the former because there is more 
substantial information on them and their activities.

Their architecture and decoration reflected the aesthetic taste of the 
Janissaries. From accounts of the condition of Janissary barracks, coffee 
houses and even 
tents during military expeditions, one gets 
the 
impression that Janissaries placed much 
importance on cleanliness, 
beauty and decoration, even in their most ‘corrupt’ times. Janissary art 
and aesthetics seem to have been neglected in Ottoman history. After 
all, the world famous and much studied architect, Sinan, came out of 
the corps and took part in military expeditions for many years before he 
became Süleyman the Magnificent’s chief architect in his fifties.

The state showed very little tolerance of devlet sohbeti. Those who were 
involved, of whom a great number were Janissaries, were exiled. There 
was even a case of women being imprisoned for engaging in political 
discussion in the public bath. The authorities did not even spare the 
places where such discussion took place, and thus a number of barber 
shops and coffee houses were closed down. See, Câbî Ömer Efendi,

The corps became a major actor in politics and in emergency situations 
entered into pragmatic and short-lived alliances with other actors such 
as the ulema and esnaf as times and conditions allowed. When a sultan 
died, the support of the Janissaries during the temporary vacuum of 
political power was considered vital by the rival princes aspiring to the 
throne. Kafadar, ‘Yeniçeri-esnaf relations’, pp. 68–9.

31. 
In Câbî Târihi, Câbî Ömer Efendi relays to us the arguments advanced 
by the Janissaries. According to them, the elite (‘paşalılar’) were always 
after their self-interest (vol. 1, p. 131), got rich through unlawful means 
(vol. 1, p. 487), and while sitting 
in 
their mansions blamed 
the 
Janissaries for all the troubles and even accused them of treason (vol. 1, 
pp. 377, 487). Their argument continues that the elite alleged that 
Janissaries did not do their duties, wasted state money, prepared their 
plots and conspiracies at both coffee house and barrack, and even in the 
battlefield, as it was claimed by the elite that the Janissaries ‘fought for 
money, not for religion’ (vol. 1, p. 116 and vol. 2, p. 814). In their 
argument, the Janissaries go so far as to suggest that by being sent to 
battle, the authorities were ‘conspiring’ to get the Janissaries annihilated 
by enemy armies (vol. 1, pp. 118, 416, 455, 528, 659). Thus, the 
Janissary 
reach a 
‘seditious’ end 
to 
the argument: 
if 
jihad were 
obligatory on all Muslims, then statesmen and ulema must also go on 
military expeditions (vol. 1, pp. 416, 441, 445, 446). 
32. Câbî Ömer Efendi, Câbî Târihi, vol. 1, p. 287 and vol. 2, p. 992. Câbî 
Ömer Efendi gives us an idea of the scale and nature of the immigration 
from the countryside. Although ‘most of the members of the Janissary 
corps are from Anatolia’, the 25th orta was mostly composed of Kurds, 
and those from Erzurum and Van, while most of the members of the 56th 
orta were from Gerede and some were Kurdish, Câbî Târihi, vol. 1, pp.

It seems to me that the Janissaries’ devlet sohbeti began to take on a 
different form in the nineteenth century. It started to move beyond 
criticizing corrupt officials or behaviour to questioning the legitimacy 
of the political system, especially hitherto accepted principles like the 
Ottoman dynasty’s unquestioned right 
to rule and 
the concept of 
martyrdom at war. The authorities must surely have felt threatened by 
such discussions.

According to Âşıkpaşazâde, the process was the other way around: it 
was the Bektashis who received their headdress from the Janissaries.

(Istanbul: Matbaa-i 
Amire, 1332/1914) p. 205.

tions Hacı Bektaş as the patron-saint and (spiritual) sultan of the corps:

Bektâş-ı Velî. The Muhammedan gülbank, the Prophet’s light, and Ali’s 
magnanimity/Our patron-saint and sultan Hacı Bektaş. 
50. According 
to 
the 
official 
view, 
contemporary 
Bektashis 
became 
extremely ‘corrupt’. Several documents, all Hatt-ı Hümayun, from the 
Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi (Prime Ministerial Ottoman Archives) in 
Istanbul, henceforth BOA, mention the corruption issue: ‘the Bektashis 
who have opened tekkes in Eyüp, Üsküdar and Bosporus seduce and 
mislead the people’, 17351 (dated 1242/1826–7); ‘Bektashi sedition’, 
17383 
(1241/1825–6); 
‘cleansing of 
the Bektashi 
sedition’, 17322 
(1241/1825–6); ‘Bektashis who corrupt and spoil the people’, 19426 
(dated 1243/1827–8). ‘Spoiling of the people’ by the Bektashis is also 
mentioned in two contemporary sources: Dâniş Bey, Netîcetü’l-Vekayic, 
pp. 72–3; and Mehmed Escad, Üss-i Zafer, p. 214. 
John Kingsley Birge, The Bektashi Order of Dervishes (London and 
Connecticut: Luzac & Co. and Hartford Seminary Press, 1937) p. 74. 
For a dissenting voice that challenges the existence of the Bektashi–
Janissary connection, see Reha Çamuroğlu, Yeniçerilerin Bektaşiliği ve 
Vaka-i Şerriye (Istanbul: Ant Yayınları, 1991). Yet his argument is some-
what emotional, and based on reasoning rather than concrete evidence.

This is supported by Kırlı, who states that coffee houses ‘served as com-
mercial venues where merchants struck deals, ship captains arranged 
their next load and brokers looked for potential customers’. Cengiz 
Kırlı, ‘Coffeehouses: public opinion in the nineteenth-century Ottoman 
Empire’, in Armando Salvatore and Dale F. Eickelman (eds) Public Islam 
and the Common Good (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2004) p. 76. 
In this chapter, I employ the term ‘mafia’ in the sense of ‘a group of 
people of similar interests or backgrounds prominent in a particular field 
or enterprise’. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, s.v. ‘mafia’. And by 
‘mafia activities’, I mean illegal activities focusing especially on some 
business and financial transactions in the city, such as arbitrary or forced 
determination of the prices of some services or goods, claiming a share of 
someone else’s business, racketeering and coerced debt-collection.

Consider the following rather straightforward and somewhat romantic 
definition of Ottoman neighbourhood 
coffee houses: 
‘The most 
common type of coffeehouse in Istanbul. Nurtured by the local culture, 
they were therefore places of conversation whose custom was supplied 
by 
the neighborhood 
residents. At 
the 
same 
time, 
these venues 
acquired a function as hubs of social communication. The typical 
Ottoman whiled away the hours 
in the triangle formed by home, 
mosque and coffee house. With the opening of the neighbourhood 
coffeehouses 
at 
the 
end of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
everyday 
life 
embarked upon a new process of 
formation around a previously 
unknown type of space.’ Quotation from İ. Gündağ Kayaoğlu, ‘Kahve 
Sözlüğü’ (The coffee glossary), in Selahattin Özpalabıyıklar Yayıncı 
(ed.) Tanede Saklı Keyif (Coffee, Pleasures Hidden in a Bean) (Istanbul:

mudemmes … sold in the morning sooks (or markets) of Cairo and other

thirteenth Economic History Congress, Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 
2002). Although coffee and coffee houses did usher in a new kind of 
relationship between residents of early modern cities and the night, 
there were precedents to this phenomenon. Taverns, for instance, were 
places where men went after dark before and after the introduction of 
coffee to the Middle East. The associations between wine and taverns 
on the one hand and coffee and coffee houses on the other is a common 
theme in both the primary and secondary literature on coffee, and it is 
one to which we shall return below. Another connection between coffee 
and the night was the use of the drink by Sufis as a stimulant to stay 
awake during their lengthy nocturnal sessions of prayer.

not cease to act wickedly and mischievously, perniciously and refrac-
torily’. See Uriel Heyd, Ottoman Documents on Palestine, 1552–1615: A

The twentieth-century geographer Brian Beeley makes a similar argu-
ment with regards to the phenomenon of rural coffee houses replacing 
the guest rooms of private households (misafir odası or misafirhane) as 
spaces of male socialization. Beeley argues 
that newly constructed 
coffee houses in rural Anatolian villages between 1945 and 1960 served 
the needs of male villagers better than the previously preferred guest 
rooms of various families because coffee houses were larger and less 
hierarchical. Importantly, Beeley also notes that many men wanted 
coffee houses in their villages because they were symbols of urbanity 
and sophistication. Thus, Beeley shows that the village coffee house – 
what he terms ‘a modernized version of the traditional guest room’ – 
replaced a domestic space by better fulfilling its social role in the same 
way that I believe coffee houses served as domestic selamlıks for the 
poorer male residents of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Ottoman

75. There is a historic precedent in Islam for the serving and greeting of 
members of the opposite sex. The scholar of Islam Yūsuf al-Qarad āwī 
cites the following H adīth from Sah īh  Ibn Sacd al-Ans ārī to make the 
point. ‘Abū Usayd al-Sacdī invited the Prophet (peace be on him) and 
his Companions to his wedding. The food was prepared and served by 
none other than his wife, Umm Usayd. She had soaked some dates in 
milk in a stone pot overnight. When the Prophet (peace be on him) 
had finished his meal, she mashed the dates and brought the drink to 
him.’ Commenting on this H adīth, Shaykh al-Islām Ibn H ajar claims 
that a wife is allowed to serve her husband and his male guests just as 
he may serve her. He qualifies his statement, however, by saying that 
‘it is evident that her serving the visitors is allowed only if there is no 
fear of temptation and if she is properly dressed; if the wife is not 
properly dressed (as is the case with a majority of women in our time) 
her appearing in front of men is h arām ’ (al-Qaradawi, The Lawful and 
the Prohibited, pp. 168–9). Despite these statements, Ottoman women 
and men still usually entertained guests in separate quarters of the 
home.

77. Mustafa Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, pp. 141–2. Later on Âli adds that 
‘the spaciousness of one’s dwelling demonstrates worldly affluence.’ 
Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of the home as the space in 
which one will live for ‘the rest of one’s life’, by stating the following: 
‘some learned men have said, when describing house and home, “It is 
the first thing that is bought”.’ Indeed, they have added, by way of 
supplementing the expression, ‘And the last thing to be sold and come 
to an end’ (Mustafa Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, p. 143).

85. How was coffee made and what did it taste like in an eighteenth-
century mahalle coffeehouse? We have few descriptions from the period 
that might tell us something about the taste of coffee. Edward William 
Lane’s account of coffee from the late 1820s and early 1830s does, 
however, offer us a sense of coffee at that time. ‘In preparing the coffee, 
the water is first made to boil: the coffee (freshly roasted and pounded) 
is then put in, and stirred, after which the pot is again placed on the 
fire, once or twice, until the coffee begins to simmer; when it is taken 
off, its contents are poured out into the cups while the surface is yet 
creamy. The Egyptians are excessively fond of pure and strong coffee, 
thus prepared; and very seldom add sugar to it (though some do so 
when they are unwell), and never milk or cream; but a little cardamom-
seed is often added to it’ (Lane, Description of Egypt, p. 138). Katip 
Çelebi notes that 
‘if drunk at all, 
it should be drunk with sugar’ 
(Chelebi, The Balance of Truth, p. 62). Many sources mention mixing 
coffee with ginger, cloves, cardamom and the expensive ambergris. See 
Encyclopaedia Iranica, s.v. ‘coffee’; Encyclopedia of Islam, s.v. ‘kahwa’;

91. Clery, ‘Women, publicity and the coffee-house myth’, p. 175. Of course 
the Turkish word for coffee house kahvehane is basically equivalent to 
the English version. Whereas kahve does indeed mean coffee, hane, 
however, does not directly translate to house. We should also note that 
the word kahve alone is often used to refer to a coffee house. While 
hane can refer simply to the physical structure of the house, it is usually 
used more figuratively in the sense of the home, household, or family. 
Ev is the preferred word for the physical structure of the home in 
Turkish, though it too can be used to refer to the family or household. 
Interestingly, the word for one who is married is evli (literally ‘with 
house’). Thus the spatial character of the association between the home, 
marriage, and family is a very strong one in Turkish. Similarly, the 
word evlilikdışı (literally ‘outside of the state of being with house’), 
which means 
illegitimate or unlawful, again highlights 
the spatial 
element of the moral character of the home as a place of the proper. For 
a thorough discussion of related topics of vocabulary, see Leslie P.

The jurnal as a class of document in the Ottoman administrative system 
was simply a type of report commissioned by the government that only 
seems to have emerged during the middle of the nineteenth century. 
The jurnals Kırlı studies are news jurnals (havadis jurnalleri), but other 
types of jurnals included censuses, statistical reports and quarantine 
records. See Kırlı, ‘The struggle over space’, p. 184 n.3. 
An instructive comparative analysis of similar issues of speech and 
hearing is Dipesh Chakrabarty’s discussion of the Bengali social practice 
of adda, which he loosely translates as ‘the practice of friends getting 
together for long, informal and unrigorous conversations’ (p. 181). 
Most useful for our present enquiries are Chakrabarty’s comments on 
issues of place and talk, of coffee houses and tea shops, and of gender 
and sociability. See his chapter entitled ‘Adda: a history of sociality’, in 
Dipesh Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and

(al-Qaradawi, The Lawful and the Prohibited, p. 320). 
Mustafa Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, p. 96. Note here that this speech 
is described as a specifically urban phenomenon. Elsewhere Âli further 
differentiates between several kinds of gossipers: tell-tales, hypocrites, 
mischief-makers, busybodies, and backbiters (Mustafa Âli, The Ottoman 
Gentleman, pp. 55–6). For a further explanation of these categories of 
speech, see al-Qaradawi, The Lawful and the Prohibited, pp. 314–21. 
Before the nineteenth century, the state of course was involved in the 
personal and political lives of its urban subjects through the institution 
of the court, but it is important to note that disputes among individuals 
were often resolved through extrajudicial means. Cases that came to 
court did so because one or more parties in the case brought it to the 
court. In other words, the state did not go out into society seeking to 
mediate disputes between parties. This 
situation 
changed 
in

nineteenth century when the police became a more seriously invasive 
social force. Interestingly, Foucault in his discussion of heterotopias 
eloquently associates 
the advent of police with 
the absence of a 
heterotopic understanding of space. ‘The ship is the heterotopia par 
excellence. In civilizations without boats, dreams dry up, espionage 
takes the place of adventure, and the police take the place of pirates’ 
(Foucault, ‘Of other spaces’, p. 27). Thus it seems that nineteenth-
century Ottoman coffee houses were not the heterotopias of their

Indeed, the first definition of qahwa in the Arabic dictionary Lisān al-
cArab is khamr. The entry explains that coffee ‘was so named because 
drinking it suppresses the appetite for food, or in other words removes 
one’s appetite’ (Lisān al-cArab, s.v. ‘qahwa’). We will have cause below 
to return to the literary and cultural connections between wine and 
coffee. 
Chelebi, The Balance of Truth, p. 62. On 
the general medicinal 
properties of coffee and on the relative benefits of its consumption 
there was little agreement among Muslim physicians and scientists. 
Some claimed that coffee was beneficial for the stomach, lowered blood 
pressure and 
relieved most headaches. 
It could be used 
to 
treat 
smallpox, measles and haemorrhoids, and could heal wounds. Other 
physicians, however, blamed coffee for pallor, headaches, loss of libido, 
heat palpitations, nightmares, melancholy, haemorrhoids, dryness of 
the respiratory passages and insomnia. Some went so far as to say that 
coffee if consumed in excess could lead to brain disorders. While the 
Egyptian physician Dā’ūd al-Ant ākī asserted that drinking coffee with 
milk could cause leprosy, the Persian physician Ebn Kashef al-Din 
recommended washing down a lentil-sized pill of opium with coffee for 
the relief of hangovers from drinking wine. It was also recommended 
that coffee only be drunk after a light breakfast known in Persian as 
takht al-qahva (literally, ‘the foundation of coffee’). In Turkish also, the 
word for breakfast (kahvaltı) derives from the fusion of the words kahve 
(coffee) and altı (beneath or lower). Literally, then, kahvaltı means 
coffee’s foundation or coffee’s underneath. The humoral qualities of 
coffee were also in question. Some physicians thought coffee was cold 
and dry and 
therefore associated with black bile and melancholy. 
Others ascribed to coffee the qualities of being hot and dry, which

meant that coffee was associated with yellow bile and the choleric. See

For the most sustained study of wine in Arabic poetic traditions, see 
Philip F. Kennedy, The Wine Song in Classical Arabic Poetry: Abū Nuwās 
and the Literary Tradition (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997). 
In taverns, coffee was like wine initially drunk from a communal cup 
that was passed around. Interestingly, this tradition of sharing was also 
observed in dervish lodges where coffee was drunk to help dervishes 
stay awake. The move from communal vessel to individual cup occur-
red quite early in coffee’s history in the Middle East, sometime during 
the middle of the fifteenth century. For more on the history of coffee 
cups in the Middle East, see Edward J. Keall, ‘The evolution of the first 
coffee cups in Yemen’, in Michel Tuchscherer (ed.) Le Commerce du café 
avant l’ère des plantations coloniales: espaces, réseaux, sociétés (XVe–XIXe

coast of Galata in 1562. See Andrews and Kalpaklı, The Age of Beloveds, 
p. 81. My thanks to Walter G. Andrews for alerting me to this couplet 
and to the previously cited poem and for help with its translation. 
Andrews and Kalpaklı write that in Ottoman poetry ‘a lover’s eye always 
weeps bloody 
tears’. 
In 
this 
section, 
they also engage 
in a very 
interesting discussion of the shape of the script of the Ottoman word 
şicr (poetry) and its resemblance to a crying eye (Andrews and Kalpaklı, 
The Age of Beloveds, p. 100). 
Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, p. 112. 
Coffee’s black colour meant that it was often compared with another 
black stimulant, berş, which was a drug concoction of either hemp or 
opium mixed with syrup (ibid., pp. 53, 53 notes 351–2 and 175). The 
accompaniment of various drugs with the drinking of coffee no doubt 
made this connection seem all the more apparent.

Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, p. 103 and p. 103 n.618. There was 
certainly a gendered hierarchy of coffee in the Ottoman world with the 
‘strongest’ coffee – with the fewest additives – at the top and the 
‘weakest’ – with sugar, milk and other spices and additives – at the 
bottom. Coffee with no sugar was known as erkek kahvesi (man coffee) 
and coffee with sugar was derogatorily termed kancık kahvesi (bitch 
coffee). There was also sütlü kahve (milky coffee), which was usually 
reserved for children (Kayaoğlu, ‘Kahve sözlüğü’, pp. 162–6).

The author of the anonymous Arabic manuscript Risāla fī Ahkām al-
Qahwa refers to the presence in coffee houses of ‘youths earmarked for 
the gratification of one’s lusts’. The seventeenth-century English poet 
and traveller George Sandys notes that many café owners in Istanbul 
‘keep beautiful boyes, who serve as stales [prostitutes] to procure them 
customers’. For more on these descriptions and for a general discussion 
of coffee-house boys, see Hattox, Coffee and Coffeehouses, pp. 109–10.

of the use of the word ‘public’ in this context, this quote reiterates both 
the connections between the spaces of wine and those of coffee and the 
uniqueness of these places in the spatial geography of Ottoman cities. 
Âli, The Ottoman Gentleman, p. 30. 
Later, Âli condemns the 
‘unacceptable behaviour’ of male domestic 
servants, which ‘includes entering a room in ranks but then not exiting 
it, darting about with quick motions and not staying still in one place, 
and bending the knees when offering pure water or sherbet or coffee, 
by which I mean bending over and sticking out the behind when serv-
ing, so as to make those present at the gathering hope for different joys 
and pleasures’ (ibid., p. 97).

For example, during 
the numerous 
instances 
in which Ottoman 
officials closed cafés, barber shops often took on the social role of the 
coffee house as a centre of gathering and discussion (Kafadar, ‘Self and 
others’, p. 144).
