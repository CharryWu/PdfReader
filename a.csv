The research and writing of this book have consumed more than half of my

adult life. Over the years many individuals and institutions have contributed

signiﬁcant ly to its completion. While my name alone appears on the tit le page,

and any errors are of course mine, I would like to recognize those who have

played especially signiﬁcant roles in this project.

I was able to spend a pleasant and proﬁtable year and a half researching in

Venice as a result of generous funding from several sources. Without such crucial

support, this project could never have been brought to completion. My thanks,

then, to the Brown Friends of Italian Studies, the University of Florence, Brigham

Young University, the Fulbright Commission, and the Gladys Krieble Delmas

Foundation. I am especially grateful to these latter two institutions whose gen-

erous support allowed me to spend a wonderful year in Venice accompanied by

my wife and children.

As important as ﬁnancial support is to the completion of any project, even

more meaningful to me has been the personal support and encouragement I have

received from many individuals both in the United States and in Italy. While a

student at Brown University, I was very fortunate to work closely with several

members of the faculty. These include Engin Akarli, Philip Benedict, Juergen

Schulz, and Amy Remensnyder. I am especially grateful to Anthony Molho. He

challenged me great ly during my graduate school years but also encouraged me,

helped me to obtain research funding, and suggested out lets where I could pre-

sent and publish my work. He was an ideal mentor and has become a good friend.

Others who have provided encouragement, constructive criticism, and moral

support include Edward Muir, Margaret King, Stanley Chojnacki, Palmira Brum-

mett, Camal Kadafar, Joanna Drell, Emily O’Brien, Kurt Graham, Frank Chris-

tianson, David D’Andrea, Karl Appuhn, Christopher Carlsmith, Bruce Casson,

Moníque O’Connell, and Marilyn Cooper. In Italy, Giovanni Levi, Francesca Triv-

ellato, Maria Fusaro, Michael Knapton, Paolo Preto, and Rheinhold C. Mueller all

provided much appreciated assistance and advice at various stages of my re-

search. In Venice, Gabriele Argenti and his family provided a poor graduate

student with room and board and a lasting friendship. Lucio Gabrieli and Mauro

Saccardo introduced me to the Venice hidden behind its facades. Vittorio Man-

delli explained the intricacies of Venetian institutions and the complexities of the

Venetian language and always guarded my seat at posto numero uno in the Archi-

vio di stato. Thanks to Daryl and Mary Lee, Shawn and Kelly Miller, John and

Melissa Snyder, and Kip Clark for friendship and regular distractions from writ-

ing and research. John Snyder also provided artistic and technical assistance with

the book’s images.

A special mention goes to the archivists and sta√ members of the archives and

libraries in which I worked in Venice. Dr. Maria Pia Pedani-Fabris of the Archivio

di stato assisted me both in the archive and with her own work on Veneto-

Ottoman relations. Roberto Greggio, formerly of the Archivio di stato, merits

special mention. He took the time to explain the barely indexed notarial records at

the heart of this study to a slight ly bewildered graduate student and generously

shared the private indices he had prepared while reorganizing this collection. His

personal kindness and interest made my many months of research pleasant and

fruitful.

The extensive revisions required to transform a 650-page dissertation into a

manageable book manuscript were accomplished against the musical backdrop

of All Soul’s Vespers: Requiem Music from Cordoba Cathedral and Nova Cantica-Latin

Songs of the High Middle Ages, which served both to put my mind into the appropri-

ate historical context and to drown out the exuberance of my children.

Friends, colleagues, students, and institutions at Brigham Young University

have been of great assistance in bringing this project to completion. Craig Harline

and Michael Farmer read various versions of the manuscript and provided helpful

suggestions on how to improve it. Donald Harreld also read the manuscript and

provided key references that great ly shaped my thinking on merchant nations

and community. De Lamar Jensen and Douglas Tobler nurtured and inspired my

love for history early on. The College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences and

the History Department have been consistent ly supportive with both funds and

time, as has the David M. Kennedy Center. Special thanks to Deans Clayne Pope

and David Magleby and to Je√rey Ringer, for their support. Thanks are also due

to the sta√ of the Harold B. Lee Library who tracked down almost every ob-

scure book or article I requested. The maps were produced by Whitney Fae Taylor

and Brandon Jones of the Brigham Young University Map Lab. Crystal Moore-

Walker, Anais Haas, and Daniel Daines took care of all the small things as my

research students. Finally, without the support and wisdom of a great department

chair, Frank Fox, this book would never have been completed. All young schol-

ars should have such a chair to help them navigate the shoals along the road

to tenure.

My most important acknowledgment must go to my family, who have accom-

panied, supported, and cheered me along this long road. Without the material

and, even more, the moral, support of my parents, Larry and Tamra Dursteler, I

would never have switched career paths in midstream. Their unfailing assistance

and conﬁdence have been a source of strength to me and my family. This book

has evolved against the backdrop of my real career as husband and father. When

this odyssey began, Lauren was starting kindergarten and Collin was still in

diapers. Now Lauren is ready to leave for college, Collin is starting high school,

and another child, Addy Serena, who was named after La Serenissima, the city

where she started her life, has rounded out our family. My children have made the

trip so much brighter with their enthusiasm for their dad’s obsession; they have

provided needed distraction and comic relief, and they have helped me always

maintain a balanced perspective on life. Finally, this book would never have

been started or completed without the support and encouragement of my wife,

Whitney. Whenever I was in danger of slipping beneath the waves, she kept me

aﬂoat. These pages are dedicated to her.

15,"Introduction

In early June 1614, ﬂeeing a failed love a√air, one of the early modern era’s

most intrepid travelers, Pietro della Valle, set out from the Venetian port of Mala-

mocco. A poet, an orator, and a soldier, the twenty-eight-year-old scion of a noble

Roman family sailed on the Gran Delﬁno, a Venetian war galleon armed with

forty-ﬁve artillery pieces that all but guaranteed a safe passage amid the corsairs

that infested the Mediterranean. His objective was one of the most popular and

intriguing destinations of early modern travelers, the seat of the sultan of the

Ottoman Empire, Constantinople.∞ This departure marked the beginning of an

eleven-year ‘‘pilgrimage of curiosity’’ that would take the Roman through Otto-

man and Persian lands, and eventually as far as India. During his travels, della

Valle actively engaged the cultures he encountered: he ‘‘copied ancient inscrip-

tions, collected oriental manuscripts, dug up Egyptian mummies, researched

Arabic science, translated or even composed Persian literature,’’ and even mas-

tered several of the region’s languages. Because of the breadth and depth of

his travels and experiences, he has been recognized as a particularly astute and

thoughtful early modern cultural reporter.≤ Della Valle’s voyage into the east

lasted just over two months, and he landed in Galata,≥ Constantinople’s cos-

mopolitan suburb across the Golden Horn on August 15, 1614.

During the course of his voyage, della Valle composed a detailed and sugges-

tive description of the ‘‘men and women, soldiers, sailors, merchants and pas-

sengers,’’ some ﬁve hundred in total, who accompanied him. He paid particular

attention to his fellow travelers, who were a decidedly diverse lot: ‘‘There were

Catholic Christians, heretics of various sects, Greeks, Armenians, Turks, Per-

"
16,"2

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

sians, Jews, Italians from almost all cities, French, Spanish, Portuguese, English,

Germans, Flemings, and to conclude in a few words, [people] of almost all reli-

gions, and nations of the world.’’∂

Della Valle’s taxonomy represents his attempt to both order and describe the

people he encountered. It illustrates the complexity of the world in which he

traveled, as well as two of the primary markers of early modern identity, religion

and nation. The image of the ‘‘medley of this company,’’ as della Valle describes it,

sharing the limited space of the Gran Delﬁno— eating, drinking, conversing, pass-

ing the long days together for more than two months— also hints at unexpected

possibilities of cultural exchange in the Mediterranean of the seventeenth cen-

tury. Della Valle saw nothing unusual or troubling in the diverse mix of his fellow

travelers; indeed he described his experience with them as ‘‘truly delightful,’’

which suggests the potential for seemingly antagonistic cultures to interact and

even coexist.∑ It is this nexus between identity and coexistence, speciﬁcally in the

context of the relationship between the two great early modern Mediterranean sea

powers— the Venetian and the Ottoman empires— that is the focus of this study.

c o e x i s t e n c e

The intersection of cultures has attracted much scholarly attention since at

least the anthropological turn that produced the ‘‘new cultural history.’’∏ The most

important initial studies were usually within the context of European expansion

and encounters with the societies of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.π More re-

cent ly the cultural pluralism of the Mediterranean has been rediscovered: as della

Valle’s experience suggests, it represents an excellent laboratory in which to pose

questions regarding identity, cultures, and the ways in which individuals and

groups interacted in times of peace and of conﬂict.∫ Because of their long and

unique shared history, their abundant archival resources for the early modern

period, and the richness of their modern historiographical traditions, the relation-

ship between the Venetian and the Ottoman empires represents an ideal case

study for examining the nature of cultural contacts in the Mediterranean.Ω

In the case of Venice, scholars in recent years have been drawn to the multi-

cultural character of the city and the possibility of analyzing diverse groups inter-

acting in ‘‘relative harmony,’’ both in the city itself and in its expansive eastern

empire, the stato da mar.∞≠ In the early modern era, the Venetian Empire was

uniquely situated to function as both boundary and cultural middle ground, ‘‘a

place of transition’’ in which people from throughout the Mediterranean and

"
17,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

3

from every corner of Europe came together. As Luigi Groto wrote in 1616, Venice

was like ‘‘ ‘a tiny dot on a great sphere’ towards which all the civilizations of the

Mediterranean converge.’’∞∞ A culturally diverse group of merchants, travelers,

and o≈cials regularly mixed in the cities of the Venetian Empire, and indeed,

many travelers felt in entering the lagoon that they had already arrived in the

exotic ‘‘Orient.’’ This pluralistic mien is vividly depicted in the narrative scenes of

painters such as Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio.∞≤ As William McNeill

evocatively described it, the Venetian Empire represented the frontier of the Euro-

pean world, the hinge between east and west.∞≥ Similarly, because of the diversity

of the cultures that mixed within its borders and the complexity of their con-

vergence over an extended period of time, cultural historians have also increas-

ingly been drawn to the study of the Ottoman Empire.

Because of their lengthy common border and shared engagement in the east-

ern Mediterranean, for almost ﬁve hundred years, the histories of Venice and the

Ottoman Empire were tight ly intertwined. From its earliest days, Venice’s for-

tunes were direct ly founded on its Levantine trade, and during the Byzantine

Empire’s waning centuries the city-state emerged as the dominant European

commercial power in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as a signiﬁcant political

and military force, with colonies and outposts in Dalmatia and the Aegean and

Ionian Seas. As Byzantium declined, the Ottomans increasingly assumed the role

of Venice’s partner and rival. Already in the late thirteenth century, because

Venice’s eastern territories were direct ly in its path, the Ottoman expansion be-

gan to have important political and commercial implications for both states.∞∂

Well before the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Venice recognized the chang-

ing political and commercial tides, and gradually established closer ties with the

Ottoman sultans.

While all major European polities at one time or another maintained diplo-

matic and commercial relations with the Ottoman Empire, none did so to the

extent of the Republic of Venice.∞∑ Commerce was the initial basis of this relation-

ship: for a time in the ﬁfteenth century, after disposing of the Genoese challenge,

Venice nearly monopolized Mediterranean trade. This imbalance of economic

power in the region was perceived as a threat by the sultans, who implemented

policies to weaken Venice’s stranglehold on Levantine commerce. These policies,

combined with challenges from commercial competitors both old and new, grad-

ually chipped away at the Venetians’ monopoly in the di≈cult sixteenth century,

yet Venice remained among the Ottomans’ most important international trading

partners well into the seventeenth century.∞∏ To be sure, Venetian and European

"

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

The Eastern Mediterranean

trade, more generally, represented a relatively marginal part of the Ottoman econ-

omy, dwarfed by the much larger domestic market. This is not to say that Otto-

mans were indi√erent to commerce with Venice; indeed Venetian luxury goods

remained highly sought after in the Porte.∞π For Venetians, however, even in the

changed economic environment of the sixteenth century, the Levant continued to

occupy a place of primacy in their collective imagination, and many believed,

as did Girolamo Priuli, that their city’s fortunes were still inseparably tied to

the east.∞∫

The Ottomans also a√ected Venice’s political a√airs in the Italian peninsula:

while it carved out an increasingly powerful terraferma state, in part as a response

to the Ottoman expansion, that same threat served as a counterweight that kept

the city-state from shifting the Italian balance of power decisively in its favor.∞Ω

The disastrous wars with the Ottomans in 1463 and 1499, the near cataclysm of

Cambrai in 1509, and the troubled years leading up to the treaty of Bologna in

1530 all made Venice painfully aware of its changed status and led its rulers to

pursue a realpolitik policy of neutrality, a tricky balancing act between the French,

"
19,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

5

the Habsburgs, and, most important ly, the Ottomans. As Guicciardini observed,

the Venetians’ experience with the Ottoman Empire over the half century after the

conquest of Constantinople taught them that ‘‘knowing well the art of defense’’

was better ‘‘than engaging the enemy in batt le.’’≤≠ From the ﬁrst years of the

sixteenth century, ‘‘the Serenissima lived between the anvil of the Habsburgs and

the hammer of the Turks,’’ or as described by a papal nuncio, ‘‘between two

counterweights.’’≤∞ The extent to which this stance of neutrality permeated Vene-

tian society is evidenced in the assertion of a young citizen bureaucrat who

a≈rmed that in his o≈cial duties he would not favor one prince over another as

was required of ‘‘everyone who was born in Venice, city of great concord and of

great neutrality.’’≤≤

Venice’s was not a true neutrality, however; rather, the Signoria was involved in

a di≈cult and sensitive ‘‘game of balance’’ and of ‘‘equivocation,’’ trying to play

one power o√ the other. The Venetians used diplomacy, a system of ever-shifting

alliances, and control over the dissemination of information to both the Habs-

burgs and the Ottomans in a sometimes desperate e√ort to appease and manipu-

late both states into positions favorable to the weakened republic as it confronted

a brave new Mediterranean world.≤≥ In the ﬁnal equation, however, Venice’s

rulers clearly understood that their city’s economic and political viability was most

closely linked to their ability to maintain good relations with the dominant Medi-

terranean power of the day, the Sublime Porte. When presented with the pos-

sibility of obtaining peace with the Habsburgs, the patrician Lunardo Emo ‘‘wept

at the speaker’s platform’’ as he warned his fellow senators against angering the

Ottomans by choosing Charles V over Süleyman. A similar pro-Ottoman position

was also the keystone of Doge Andrea Gritti’s diplomatic policy.≤∂

Venice’s dependence on Ottoman goodwill was everywhere evident: after the

discovery of the Cape route, for example, it became clear that only the sultans

were powerful enough to challenge Portuguese monopolization of the spice

trade; thus Venice pursued ‘‘a more subt le, even submissive, policy toward the

Ottomans,’’ which led to a resurgence in the trade by 1550.≤∑ Venice’s submission

was further encouraged by its reliance on Ottoman grain, which was so signiﬁ-

cant that one o≈cial reported that Venice’s Dalmatian subjects would die of

famine if the Ottoman trade were ever interrupted.≤∏ In addition, Venice’s mili-

tary forces often depended on the recruitment of Ottoman subjects, most notably

the famed stradioti, a reliance that Girolamo Priuli decried as being like a ‘‘man

cutting o√ his penis to spite his wife.’’≤π Politically and economically, then, there is

litt le question that after 1470, Venetian well-being was subject to the favor of the

sultans, which earned the city the sobriquet, ‘‘the Turk’s Courtesan,’’ and much

"
20,"6

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

disdain among the corps of Christendom. Of Venice, Pius II said famously, if

over-simply, ‘‘too much intercourse with the Turks has made you the friends of

the Mohammedans and you care no more for religion.’’≤∫

Although circumstances occasionally dictated a momentary shift in this policy,

Venice was generally successful in maintaining its neutral stance, evidenced most

conspicuously in the rarity after 1503 of open conﬂict with the Ottomans.≤Ω In-

deed, one of the striking, but often overlooked, features of Veneto-Ottoman rela-

tions in the early modern period is the degree to which the two powers’ relations

were characterized by coexistence rather than conﬂict. From 1500 to the fall of the

Venetian Republic in 1797, Venice and the Ottoman Empire were at peace, save

for several relatively brief interludes of open hostility, punctuated by raiding and

other corsair activities. These moments of open warfare were generally short-

lived (with the exception of the War of Candia from 1645 to 1669) and were

distinguished more by attempts on both sides to repair the rupture quickly than

by total warfare. Thus, while hostility was certainly one aspect of Veneto-Ottoman

relations, in many ways it must be seen as exceptional against this backdrop

of peace.

This reality of Ottoman and Venetian coexistence is in many ways at odds with

the way the encounter between the major religious cultures of the Mediterranean

has been characterized. In these depictions, relations between Europe and the

Ottoman Empire, and more broadly between Christianity and Islam, are gener-

ally reduced to a shorthand of binary oppositions—East /West, Muslim /Christian,

Venetian /Turk, Europe /Other. This dichotomy is readily apparent in the tit les

of important monographs: Islam and the West, Europe and the Turk, Venezia e i

turchi.≥≠ The continued currency and persistence of this ‘‘oppositional frame-

work’’≥∞ among the general population as well as scholars is evident in the inﬂu-

ential ‘‘clash of civilizations’’ model that Samuel P. Huntington has posited, as

well as in many works produced in the wake of the events of September 2001 and

the subsequent hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq.≥≤

This bipartite vision of the early modern Mediterranean world is a product of

the complex interaction of both historical and historiographical trends. Histori-

cally, its roots extend back to biblical representations of Near Eastern foes, but

especially to the epic confrontation between classical Greece and the Persian

Empire. In the postclassical era this clash metamorphosed into the inheritance

struggle between the two great religious o√spring of the classical world, Islam

and Christendom. Each posed the threat of ‘‘conquest and conversion’’ to the

other, though this was especially true in the case of Christendom, which progres-

sively lost ground in Islam’s early centuries.≥≥ In Europe, one product of this

"
21,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

7

political and religious rivalry was an extensive anti-Muslim and anti-Ottoman

literature that demonized the other and contrived to inspire crusades to liberate

cruelly oppressed lands under the heel of Islam. In the nineteenth and twentieth

century, nationalists (both Christian and Muslim) seeking to explain the political

and economic retardation and cultural marginalization of their nascent nation-

states drew on this polemical literary body to blame their failings on the deaden-

ing inﬂuence of the repressive Ottoman rule.≥∂ This vision convenient ly ignored

centuries of coexistence and the relatively tolerant attitude of the Ottoman state

toward its minority populations,≥∑ and a narrative of subjugation at Ottoman

hands became entrenched in western intellectual culture, which resulted in mod-

ern political and religious antagonisms being teleologically imprinted onto the

past.≥∏ Likewise, the ﬁssures of the cold war era were reﬂected onto the past,

depicting the Mediterranean as cleanly divided into two civilizational camps,

opposed to each other geographically, culturally, and religiously, and each driven

to impose its own image on the other in an ideological war of the worlds.≥π The

current of anti-Turkish and anti-Islamic opinion persists today, fed by stereo-

typical depictions of Islam in western media, and by events such as the ‘‘war on

terror’’ and the recent debate over Turkey’s entry into the European Union, which

the papacy has opposed on the grounds that Islam is ‘‘in permanent contrast to

Europe.’’≥∫

These Manichean historical currents have been mirrored in the historiography

of the encounter between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Since the nineteenth

century, signiﬁcant bodies of historical literature have focused on two fundamen-

tal aspects of the millennial engagement of these Mediterranean cultures: image

and impact. One of the most common early approaches to the study of the Otto-

man Empire by western scholars examined the impact of the ‘‘Turks’ ’’ presence

and expansion on Europe. Foundational early works, such as Johann Wilhelm

Zinkeisen’s Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches in Europa and Nicolae Iorga’s Ge-

schichte des osmanischen Reiches were supplemented in the mid-twentieth century

by Dorothy Vaughan’s Europe and the Turk, Paul Coles’s The Ottoman Impact

on Europe, and Gibb and Bowen’s Islamic Society and the West. These scholars

focused to a greater or lesser degree on Ottoman history, but they also promi-

nent ly dealt with the diplomatic and political implications that the Ottoman threat

presented to European society and civilization. While signiﬁcant contributions

of historical scholarship, these works were based on a ‘‘clash of civilizations’’

model in their treatment of Ottoman-European relations and insisted on a funda-

mental opposition between two essentially di√erent and ultimately incompatible

cultures.≥Ω

"
22,"8

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Parallel to this history of the Ottoman impact, other scholars advanced a

cultural-intellectual history, a literature of the image of the ‘‘Turk’’ in European

culture. Works such as Clarence Dana Rouillard’s pioneering The Turk in French

History, Thought, and Literature, Samuel Chew’s The Crescent and the Rose, R. W.

Southern’s Western Views of Islam in the Middle Ages, Norman Daniel’s Islam and

the West: The Making of an Image, Robert Schwoebel’s The Shadow of the Crescent,

and Paolo Preto’s Venezia e i turchi all were concerned, at their core, with the

manner in which Islam and the Turks were perceived and depicted as the Chris-

tian and European other.∂≠ A number of recent publications suggest that this

fascination with the representations of Islam in European society continues.∂∞

Generally, this literature of image has unfolded in rich detail the virulent portrayal

of Islam and Muslims within European society, and especially within European

literature. This historiography is based on the seemingly endless literary out-

put in Christendom devoted to explaining, demonizing, and dismissing Islam

throughout their long, shared history.∂≤ While some of these scholars have been

more nuanced in their discussion of the image of the ‘‘Turk,’’ acknowledging

changes in views over time and diversity in attitudes depending on proximity, in

the ﬁnal analysis, the literature of image most often has painted a synchronic

picture of hostility and misunderstanding that varies litt le from the Middle Ages

into the early modern era.∂≥

This binary narrative of opposition, misunderstanding, and animosity that has

dominated the historiographical discourse has in recent years been questioned by

scholars who have argued for the need to approach the encounter between Islam

and Christianity with a more nuanced view of the nature of culture and cultural

interaction. These scholars maintain that structuralist and essentialist assump-

tions that reify abstractions such as nation, culture, religion, or civilization, and

assume an inherent division and oppositional relationship between metacatego-

ries such as East and West, have obscured a more complex and varied reality. The

traditional picture assumes a degree of cultural unity and homogeneity within

these groups, and an unwavering antagonism between them, which is at odds

with both the new cultural historians’ more sophisticated understanding of cul-

tures and with the ﬂuidity of borders and identities during the premodern period.

Cultural contact and interaction were messier, more contradictory, and variable

than this two-dimensional, static pattern allows.∂∂

In terms of the literature of image, this revisionist view has challenged the

often monotone and static depiction of previous image literature that limned

Islam and the Ottoman Empire solely ‘‘as a barbarous monster.’’ Maxime Rodin-

son, for example, argues that ‘‘Christian Europe did not, as is commonly as-

"
23,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

9

sumed, have one, but several images’’ of Islam.∂∑ Lucette Valensi shows how in

the Venetian relazioni there existed alongside the traditional rhetoric an admira-

tion for the strength of the Ottoman state’s institutions and the courage of its

soldiers.∂∏ She and other scholars have right ly pointed out the literary rumblings

of a break with the medieval dogmas among some early modern observers. Fol-

lowing the conquest of Constantinople, Europe developed closer political and

economic ties with the Ottoman Empire, giving rise to a greater curiosity and a

need for more accurate information regarding the Ottomans. Growing numbers

of travelers between east and west both were a product of and contributed to this

demand.∂π Another important element in this evolving picture was the spread of

printing. As Rouillard suggests and others have since shown, this surge in infor-

mation on and interest in the ‘‘Turks’’ led to increasing treatments of the matter

in European art and literature, with subt le increases in objectivity and accuracy.∂∫

Indicative of Europe’s fascination and preoccupation with its neighbor is that in

France alone, from 1492 to 1630 four times more books were published on the

Ottoman Empire than on the New World.∂Ω Not surprisingly, some of the most

nuanced and popular discussions of the Ottomans were contained in the relazioni

of the Venetian baili who served in Constantinople, charged as they were to

provide balanced, accurate information intended to guide the republic’s very

sensitive Ottoman policies.∑≠

In response to the traditional literature of impact, some scholars have begun

to question the axiomatic view that emphasizes the ﬁxed nature and adversarial

character of Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Instead they have proposed a more

complex approach to both identity and cultural interaction. Recent research,

particularly by Ottomanists such as Cemal Kafadar, Suraiya Faroqhi, Palmira

Brummet— but also Peter Sahlins writing on early modern France, Molly Greene

and Sally McKee on Crete, Jeremy Prestholdt on East Africa, and Joan-Pau Rubiés

on India∑∞—has made meaningful strides toward developing a more sophisticated

model of cultural interaction that rejects the essentialization of identity and the

reduction of the Mediterranean to a series of oppositional metacategories.∑≤ Their

work has challenged the ‘‘totalizing concept of the ‘Other’ ’’ expressed in Edward

Said’s inﬂuential orientalist model as conceptually limiting and reductionist in

interpreting and explaining cultural exchanges. They have argued instead for the

need to ‘‘disarticulate the notion’’ that the premodern Mediterranean world ‘‘was

composed of isolated blocks, secure and content in their foreignness.’’∑≥ Indeed,

Richard Bulliet in a recent, provocative work contends that far from being dia-

metrically opposed as in Huntington’s ‘‘clash of civilizations’’ model, the histories

of Christendom and Islam are so closely intertwined that the Mediterranean

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

ought to be envisioned in terms of a shared ‘‘Islamo-Christian’’ civilization.∑∂

Linda Darling’s epitaph on the old view of the encounter between Islam and

Christianity suggests the degree to which the paradigm has begun to shift: ‘‘The

idea that the west is eternally opposed to the east, that the east stood still while the

west progressed, should be relegated to the horse-and-buggy era as something

once believed but no longer credible, like the ﬂat earth, spontaneous generation,

or the medical use of leeches.’’∑∑

i d e n t i t y

One of the core issues in the emerging discourse on Mediterranean culture

focuses on identity. Questions of identity have, of course, permeated much recent

discourse, both erudite and popular. Inﬂuenced by both the new cultural his-

tory and postmodernist reﬂections on identity, scholars have increasingly aban-

doned the structuralist-essentialist model for a view of self that emphasizes its

ﬂuidity and socially constructed character.∑∏ This shift has been informed by cur-

rent events, including mass migrations, the breakup and refashioning of long-

standing nation-states, and the breakdown of linguistic, cultural, economic, and

political boundaries in the era of globalization.∑π In Europe, the growth and ex-

pansion of the European Union has produced a wide-ranging examination of

European identity. Because of its religious and ethnic diversity, its status as a

Christian and Muslim cultural middle ground, and the degree of geographic

mobility in the region, the Mediterranean has become a fashionable focus for

discussions of both cultural convergence and identity.

While much has been written on identity in the context of the modern world,

we know decidedly less about it in the early modern era. To get some sense of the

way in which contemporaries understood both themselves and how they conﬁg-

ured their world, we return to Pietro della Valle’s intellectual pilgrimage. In his

taxonomy della Valle lines up his fellow travelers into two parallel columns: the

ﬁrst includes ‘‘Catholic Christians, heretics of various sects, . . . Turks, . . . Jews’’;

the second ‘‘Greeks, Armenians, . . . Persians, . . . Italians from almost all Cities,

French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Germans, Flemings.’’ In short, della Valle

concludes, his companions represent ‘‘almost all religions, and nations of the

world.’’∑∫ These two categories— religion and nation— are essential to della Valle’s

conceptualization, and along with social hierarchies, they are the key categories of

identity that contemporaries mobilized to order their world.

The ﬁrst labels della Valle employs are religious: he divides his fellow travelers

into Catholics, heretics, Jews, and Turks. During the early modern period religion

"
25,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

11

remained one of the primary elements of individual and group identity. Where

political status had perhaps comparatively minimal signiﬁcance, religion was a

fundamental constituent of identity because of its ability to ‘‘penetrate the masses

of a population’’ in a way which pre-modern states were unable.∑Ω If Europeans no

longer realistically harbored hopes for a united Christendom and regularly re-

ferred to themselves less by religious than regional and cultural signiﬁers, and if

the Islamic world was rent by its own internal divisions, religion remained at the

core a key, even assumed, element in constructions of identity.

In situations in which religious pluralism existed, religious identiﬁers were

particularly common. This is evident in the general tendency among Christian

Europeans to group the widely diverse elements of Islam generically under the

rubric ‘‘Turk.’’ Although an ethnic and linguistic term, ‘‘Turk’’ was widely used in

this period as a religious catch-all to describe all Muslims.∏≠ Curiously, the same

term was also employed occasionally to describe Protestants.∏∞ In the Ottoman

Empire, people were usually classiﬁed by religion, not language or ethnicity, and

Ottomans often referred to Christians ‘‘not in territorial or national terms but

simply as inﬁdels [kaﬁr ].’’ Indeed the popular view was ‘‘al-Kufr kulluhu milla

wahida [unbelief constitutes one nation].’’∏≤

In acknowledging the enduring importance of religion in questions of identity,

however, we should not assume that religion was the only determining factor

either in constructions of identity or in conceptualizing the world. The ideological

clash between Islam and Christianity did not dictate all the actions of every early

modern man and woman all the time. Muslims and Christians were not per-

petually engaged in a life-and-death struggle: ‘‘coexistence and symbiosis were

possible’’ and almost certainly the quotidian norm rather than the exception.∏≥

While modern observers often attribute an unwavering religiosity to the medieval

and early modern periods, the reality was inﬁnitely more tangled. Many individ-

uals moved easily between religious poles, and indeed polities were never averse

to allying with a perceived inﬁdel if the stakes were right. Robert Donia and John

Fine have shown that Bosnian nobles were generally ‘‘indi√erent to religious

issues. They intermarried and formed alliances across denominational lines;

when it suited their worldly aims, they changed faiths easily.’’∏∂ Evidence from

throughout Venice’s stato da mar and across the Mediterranean provides innu-

merable instances of religious migration across seemingly inviolable boundaries

and suggests that frontiers of faith were more porous than we have previously

believed.∏∑ This same ‘‘confessional ambiguity’’ of the Mediterranean was also

evident in Reformation Europe in relations between Catholics and Protestants.∏∏

Even when religious boundaries were not violated, a certain religious syncretism

"
26,"12

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

existed among Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim in the Mediterranean who shared

popular beliefs in miraculous saints and the e≈cacy of Christian baptism.∏π

In the political realm too, apparent ly rigid divisions between Christian and

Muslim states, proved much more pliable than is often acknowledged. Venice, of

course, had litt le trouble breaking with Christendom to treat with the Ottoman

Empire; indeed the city was famed for the position expressed by the Senate after

Lepanto, ‘‘Prima semo veneziani, poi cristiani [ﬁrst we are Venetians, then Chris-

tians].’’∏∫ Even at this moment of glory following the ﬁrst major defeat of the

Ottomans in memory, Venice clearly recognized the importance of pursuing an

independent policy in opposition to the crusading stance advocated by the papacy

and Spain, and it soon broke with its Christian allies to sue for a separate peace.

Venice was not alone in this openness to the Ottomans: in the same breath

European powers could decry Venice and its policies, demonize the ‘‘Turks’’ as

inﬁdels, and still attempt to beneﬁt from relations with the sultans themselves.∏Ω

At one time or another, almost every European power, including the papacy, made

overtures toward the sultans and even established open alliances with them.π≠

Peasants too were generally more interested in the oppressiveness of their sov-

ereigns’ rule than in their religion. A sixteenth-century Balkan maxim stated,

‘‘better the turban of the Turk than the tiara of the Pope,’’ and peasants through-

out the Mediterranean often voted with their feet by ﬂeeing Christian rule for

Ottoman or even assisting the sultans’ forces in their conquests of Christian

lands. This ambiguity was succinct ly expressed by Luther: ‘‘A smart Turk makes a

better ruler than a dumb Christian.’’π∞

In the case of Islam, the familiar maxim that religion subsumed all and that

‘‘unbelief constituted one nation’’ is generally invalid, but especially so in the case

of the Ottomans, who derived from their frontier milieu a cultural mix of classical

Islamic legal traditions joined with Byzantine and Inner Asian elements. Otto-

man society was particularly open to Christians and Jews, and the cases of non-

Muslims or converts to Islam who played leading roles in the Ottoman state

are too common to enumerate. In the early modern era, the Ottomans engaged in

close economic, political, and cultural relations with many so-called inﬁdel pow-

ers and were very open to importing ‘‘Western’’ ideas and specialists. Indeed,

while Europeans were narcissistically convinced that the sultans had ‘‘as objective

the monarchy of all the world and the destruction of Christendom,’’ in reality

Ottoman military and political e√orts were focused primarily against fellow Mus-

lim rulers in Egypt, Iran, and North Africa.π≤ The sultans also recognized and

exploited the divisions among Christians after 1517 to their political advantage.π≥

To return to della Valle, it is clear that our intrepid traveler did not conceive of

"
27,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

13

his world solely in religious terms. He divided his companions into a second,

nonreligious subset: Greeks, Armenians, Persians, French, Spaniards, Portu-

guese, English, Dutch, Germans, and Italians from all cities; in short, people

from all the ‘‘nations of the world.’’π∂ In this he was in no way unique; every early

modern traveler utilized this taxonomic category. For example, the sixteenth-

century imperial ambassador Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq wrote of encountering

‘‘Ragusans, Florentines, Venetians, and sometimes also Greeks, and men of other

nations.’’π∑ The idea of nation is, of course, notoriously imprecise, and its concep-

tual utility is seriously undermined by the signiﬁcant variance between its mod-

ern and premodern usages. Eric Hobsbawm has argued that the modern concept

of nation is ‘‘historically very young,’’ dating back at most to the eighteenth

century. Such a view of the nation is at the heart of the work of the postmodernist,

anti-essentialist views of scholars such as Ernst Gellner and Benedict Anderson

who see nations as socially constructed, ‘‘imagined communities.’’π∏ While these

important works have focused primarily on the modern era, some scholars work-

ing on premodern Europe have challenged this view, holding that the roots of the

modern concept of nation are ﬁrmly situated in the Middle Ages.ππ Although this

is not the place to engage this debate, a historically precise understanding of early

modern concepts of nation, because of its widespread usage, is crucial to under-

standing premodern identities.

Etymologically, the word nation derives from the Latin natio, which shares the

same stem as natus. In the classical era, nation referred to people born in the same

city or region, such as Jews or Syrians who resided in Rome or some other city. In

medieval and early modern times, nation retained this classical, geographical

connection with place of birth, origin, or descent.π∫ This is particularly evident in

Romance languages: Dante used nazione to refer to ‘‘men who originated in the

same province or city,’’ and an early French dictionary’s deﬁnition cited Froissart’s

‘‘je fus retourné au pays de ma nation en la conté de Haynnault [I returned to the land

of my birth in the county of Haynnault].’’ Machiavelli used the terms province

and nation, and often patria, interchangeably, as did Guicciardini.πΩ The mean-

ing of nation in the early modern period, then, remained closely linked to the

classical concept of nation as a community of people with a shared place of

origin.∫≠

Early modern Ottoman and other writers in the Muslim world utilized a con-

cept with some similarities to the premodern European notion of nation. This is

evident in the writings of the Ottoman intellectual and bureaucrat Mustafa Ali,

the historian Naima, and the seventeenth-century Ottoman poet Nabi who re-

ferred to Constantinople as ‘‘the nursery of many nations.’’∫∞ The Ottomans came

"
28,"14

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

to use the term taife, which could describe generically any group, in a similar

fashion to the premodern European uses of nation. While Ottomans referred to

Europeans generically as Franks (Ifrandj or Firandj ), they clearly recognized de-

grees of di√erence in this general category. Thus they described their own Latin-

rite Christian subjects as ‘‘tatlısu frengi, sweet-water Franks,’’ while other Euro-

pean Christians were designated ‘‘salt-water Franks,’’ and were further di√erenti-

ated into cultural and linguistic groups: ‘‘taife-ya Efrenk-i Ingiliz or taife-yi Efrenk-i

Filemenk’’ (English Franks or Dutch Franks).∫≤

The association of nation with geography is evident in the practice of using

place of birth as surname among non-nobles.∫≥ This association is also clear in a

Venetian dispatch in which Bailo Almoro Nani refers disparagingly to a certain

Mustafa, ‘‘who was by nature Greek, and as one partial to the rite of his nation

spoke more in that language than in Turkish.’’∫∂ His birth identity (his nature or

nation) was Greek, and linguistically he was Greek, but in religion he was a

‘‘Turk.’’ Nani’s observation suggests a second element of identity associated with

provenance and birth: language. To nineteenth-century nationalists, language

and nation were inseparable; in premodern times the relationship between lan-

guage and identity was signiﬁcant ly less clear-cut. While often an important piece

of the whole, language was rarely ‘‘the prime identity criterion.’’∫∑ This was evi-

denced in the unusual linguistic combinations of the nations of medieval univer-

sities, as well as the linguistic diversity of many conglomerate states, including

the Holy Roman, Venetian, Ottoman, and Spanish empires. In the case of Den-

mark, one scholar has argued that ‘‘as long as language was not considered a vital

component of man’s identity, the multilingual character of the state raised no

problems.’’∫∏ In the frontier region between France and Spain, ‘‘the Cerdans’

chosen languages of expression . . . stood in no necessary relation to their possible

identities and chosen loyalties.’’∫π In the varied world of the Ottoman Empire,

with its linguistic diversity and not insigniﬁcant body of multilingual individuals

and groups, ‘‘language was a means of communicating between peoples, not a

means of distinguishing among them.’’∫∫ The existence of the Italianate lingua

franca in the European and Mediterranean regions also served to complicate the

importance of linguistic boundaries.∫Ω

If regional provenance was one of the most important elements of ‘‘national’’

identity, it was both expressed and reinforced by language, and by other external

markers. These might include dress, foodways, and common customs, as well as

more intangible factors such as a sense of some kind of a shared historical past.Ω≠

Costume especially was an important, if easily mutable external signiﬁer of iden-

tity.Ω∞ Latin-rite Ottomans, for instance, were recognizable by their luxurious

"
29,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

15

‘‘gownes black, & . . . velvet caps,’’ which stood in contrast to the garb of Greek-

Ottomans, who wore violet-colored clothing and bonnets.Ω≤ Books that illustrated

and illuminated costume and identity were popular in the latter half of the six-

teenth century, particularly among travelers. Peter Mundy carried an illustrated

reference book during his Levantine travels, which depicted ‘‘the severall habitts

used att Constantinople, where most o≈cers and Nationes are distinguished by

their habits.’’Ω≥ While sumptuary laws were common to most polities of the day,

they were especially important in the often confusing Mediterranean world, and

particularly the Ottoman Empire.Ω∂

Beyond its integral signiﬁcance in constructions of identity, the term nation

was also used to express concepts of community. Nation was commonly applied

in a variety of cultural and institutional usages, including divisions of students at

university, or religious o≈cials at church councils.Ω∑ For the purposes of this

study, one of the most important early modern usages of nation was in reference

to communities of merchants and diplomats living abroad under the aegis of a

particular city or state. Thus early modern Constantinople was home to Venetian,

French, English, and Dutch nations. These trading and diplomatic nations were

juridically deﬁned, and membership was limited, at least in theory, to a small

cadre of individuals who met certain speciﬁc legal requirements. In practice,

these communities’ borders were much less clearly delineated, and they con-

tained individuals of many di√erent religious, linguistic, political, and geographic

backgrounds. For example, the Dutch merchant nation in Constantinople con-

sisted of subjects of the Habsburg emperors from the Southern Provinces, as well

as individuals from the Northern Provinces who were subjects of the new Dutch

Republic. Other members of the nation were ‘‘Dutch by choice, such as some

Czech Calvinists.’’ Often Protestants of every persuasion accepted the protection

of the Dutch nation, though a number of Catholic priests and monks did as well.Ω∏

If the nation-state in the nineteenth century was seen as the political expres-

sion of the cultural, even biological, volk, in premodern times nation did not

necessarily correspond to any political entity so much as to a cultural geography

that often seems random. This is evident in the accounts of our travelers who

referred to Greeks, French, Spaniards, Dutch, English, Germans, and Italians. In

some instances— the French and the English, for example—nation did generally

correspond to polity. In other cases— the German, the Greek, the Italian— it did

not. It is revealing that both della Valle and Busbecq acknowledged the complexity

of the category Italian, by further breaking it down to variations based on re-

gional, political, and cultural di√erences—Venetians, Florentines, and so forth.

Although nation was not necessarily coterminous with political status, this did

"
30,"16

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

certainly make up one possible layer of identity. As J. H. Elliott has observed,

‘‘loyalty to the home community— the sixteenth century patria—was not inher-

ent ly incompatible with the extension of loyalty to a wider community, so long as

the advantages of political union . . . outweigh[ed] the drawbacks.’’Ωπ This is

evident in the experience of the many Greek subjects of Venice’s stato da mar who

came to Constantinople to trade or work in Ottoman shipyards and galleys, and

often married and sett led in the city, never to return to their lands of birth. While

to outsiders culturally and linguistically quite indistinguishable from the many

Greek subjects of the sultan, they di√erentiated themselves as Venetian subjects

by registering annually in the embassy’s chancellery in order to avoid paying

Ottoman taxes. As Venetian subjects, they were legally under the bailo’s jurisdic-

tion, yet they often moved e√ort lessly between Ottoman and Venetian institu-

tions as circumstances dictated, playing the two systems o√ each other to their

own beneﬁt. Their identity in a sense was hyphenated—while religiously and

culturally members of the larger Greek nation that cut across several political

boundaries, as well as residents of the Ottoman Empire, which in many cases

employed them, politically they continued to identify themselves as Venetian

subjects. They were ‘‘political amphibians,’’ and they were not unique in their

adaptability.Ω∫

As the experience of Venice’s Greek subjects in Constantinople suggests, we

should not exaggerate the importance of political factors in early modern identi-

ties. Europe in this period was characterized by ‘‘vast polyglot and polyethnic’’

composite states from Vienna, Paris, and Madrid, to Constantinople.ΩΩ Certainly

the Venetian Empire qualiﬁed as a composite polity, stretching from Bergamo in

northern Italy to the islands of Crete and Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.

The empire’s physical space contained a precarious mixture of diversity, includ-

ing historically antagonistic groups, an ‘‘ethnic pluralism,’’ whose relationship to

the state was not always clear.∞≠≠ There was no natural geographical, religious,

linguistic, or cultural coherence to the state’s ‘‘heterogeneous totality of distinct

territories,’’ except that provided politically by Venice’s governing institutions.∞≠∞

Legislation recognized only a tiny minority of the empire’s inhabitants as Vene-

tian, namely the patriciate in Venice and a small number of non-noble citizens.∞≠≤

The remainder of the imperial population, and indeed the majority of Venice

proper’s inhabitants, all fell under the broad rubric of subjects. Subjects from

certain terraferma cities were accorded Venetian citizenship, but in comparison to

the patriciate and the cittadini originari, they were second-class citizens. Most of

Venice’s subjects, however, never even acquired this level of political status and

remained part of the mass of generally undi√erentiated subjects.∞≠≥ Given the

"
31,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

17

composite nature of so many contemporary polities, as well as the constant vari-

ability of political boundaries, it seems clearly unwise to attribute political divi-

sions sketched on maps too weighty a signiﬁcance in individual or communal

constructions of identity.∞≠∂

Indeed, while Venice coalesced into a reasonably viable political and economic

construction, in many ways the state remained ‘‘disorganic and fragmentary.’’∞≠∑

The often loose ties that bound Venice’s expansive empire could fail at times, as

was vividly underscored in the disaster of the War of the League of Cambrai, in

which all Venice’s mainland holdings were rapidly lost to an alliance led by the

warrior pope, Julius II.∞≠∏ Misgovernment and arrogance on the part of Venetian

o≈cials accentuated latent dissatisfaction among the ruling elites of these con-

quered territories, who in some ways viewed the dominante as an ‘‘occupying

force.’’∞≠π While these prodigal lands eventually returned somewhat sheepishly to

the fold, the trauma of the experience made manifest the weaknesses of the

Venetian state to the patriciate. The lessons of 1494 and 1509 were clear: in Italy,

governments ‘‘could not command enough support or loyalty from [their] subject

communities to have any ﬁrm faith in survival. External danger made for internal

threat.’’∞≠∫ If this were true for Venice’s terraferma state, it was even more the case

for the stato da mar. In both Cyprus and Crete, prominent local families openly

encouraged the Ottomans to attack the islands in the hopes of throwing o√ what

they perceived as oppressive Venetian rule.∞≠Ω

Contemporary observers commented on the precariousness of early modern

states. English traveler Henry Blount observed, ‘‘the Greeks lived happier under

the Turks, than [the Sicilians] under the Spanish’’ and that the Sicilians were ‘‘not

much averse from the Turkish government.’’∞∞≠ When the Duke of Florence’s

corsairs tried to liberate Chios from its Ottoman overlords, the island’s inhabi-

tants complained to Clement VIII.∞∞∞ At the core of these expressions was the

realization that for the popular majority, the real di√erence between one sov-

ereign and another, even a Muslim one, was in many ways irrelevant. This realiza-

tion and the specter of another Cambrai profoundly informed the policies and

politics of Venice’s rulers during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, par-

ticularly in their relationship to the distant and diverse regions of the stato da

mar.∞∞≤

In the ﬁnal analysis, ‘‘national’’ identity— that is, one’s sense of association

with region or place of birth— seems to have been, in many instances, stronger

than religious or political identities. This is apparent in the case of the Ottoman

grand vizier, Albanian-born, who was described as ‘‘very inclined’’ to men of his

region and language, regardless of their religion. Such identiﬁcation often bene-

"
32,"18

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

ﬁted Venice’s dragomans from the same region but on the Venetian side of the

border, who emphasized their birth and regional over their political and even

religious identity in order to facilitate their access to and negotiations with o≈-

cials at the highest levels of the Ottoman government.∞∞≥

This cursory reﬂection on identity in the early modern era has not treated a

number of other factors such as social estate, occupation, or gender, all of which

certainly were important facets of individual and group identities. Nor has it

considered the place of family in constructions of identity, which may prove to

have been the most important factor of all.∞∞∂ In describing the multivalence

of identity, my intention has not been simply to replace panoptic labels such

as Venetian or Ottoman with inelegant chains of descriptors such as Venetian-

Roman Catholic-Greek or Ottoman-Jewish. Rather, I would like to propose a

di√erent way of conceptualizing identity which divorces it from static and often

convoluted fusions of all its imaginable constituent parts. Identity in the early

modern era did not possess ‘‘an essential, primordial quality,’’ nor was it ‘‘deﬁned

by a nuclear component of social or cultural characteristics.’’ It was not an object

but rather a process, ‘‘a bundle of shifting interactions,’’ a ‘‘part of a continuum.’’

It was socially constructed, a process of deﬁning and redeﬁning or, perhaps better,

of imagining boundaries. It was then, as it is today, ‘‘contingent and relational.’’∞∞∑

Perhaps overly inﬂuenced by the nation-state paradigm, we have often over-

looked the intricacies of early modern identity and instead have categorized and

systematized the much messier reality of the prenational world into simplistic

religious and political blocs. Early modern observers, while utilizing broad orga-

nizing categories, acknowledged the possibility of individual and group identities

that were more multilayered than simply religion or nation. Busbecq, for example,

wrote of encountering a man who was an ‘‘an Italian Greek, i.e., both in birth and

manners half Greek and half Italian.’’ The English organ builder Thomas Dallam

met a man who ‘‘was a Turke, but a Cornishe man borne.’’ Another English

traveler recorded an encounter with ‘‘Mr. Wyllyam Robynsoun, ane Inglyshe

man, . . . [whom] tyme hathe so allterred . . . that he ys becom a Slavonyan in

natur.’’∞∞∏ This ﬂuidity is also evident in the mobility of merchants, artisans, and

others who became citizens of Italian city-states through adopting, and adapting

to, the culture of their new homes and being awarded citizenship by privilege.∞∞π

Clearly contemporaries were comfortable, or at least familiar, with ambiguity and

multivalence in individual identity.

We have ample evidence of the ﬂuidity of identity in the early modern Mediter-

ranean. A familiar example is that of the Marranos, who were expelled from Spain

in 1492 in part for crypto-Judaism. As one scholar has written, the Marranos

"
33,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

19

‘‘used their Jewishness instrumentally, presenting themselves, when occasion

called for it, as Jews, but as often as not assuming Christian identities.’’ Evidence

also exists of Christians in the Ottoman Empire reconﬁguring themselves simi-

larly.∞∞∫ Another group that has attracted much attention are the renegades, men

and women who crossed over from the Christian to the Muslim sphere and in so

doing violated the most elemental boundary in the early modern era.∞∞Ω They

represent a fascinating collection of individuals, and in some cases whole com-

munities, who adapted not only their political but also their religious identity in

response to a range of factors.

One might argue that because Jews and renegades exist on the margins of

society they are not representative; however, there is ample evidence of a similar

versatility and protean quality of identity among the quintessential Venetians, its

merchants. Venetian legislation required that all merchants trading under the

city’s aegis be Venetian citizens, born or naturalized; by 1550 in practice most

were the latter. Many came from the Venetian terraferma, but others were not even

culturally Venetian or Italian, such as the Helman brothers, who ﬂed the religious

troubles of the Low Countries.∞≤≠ In some cases even Ottoman subjects traded

as Venetian merchants without obtaining citizenship. The archetypal Venetian

merchant in Constantinople, then, was Venetian not by birth but as a result of

shedding— or rather adapting— cultural, political, and even religious layers of

identity in order to participate in the lucrative Levantine trade. As the Marranos,

renegades and merchants of Venice, suggest, identity in the premodern Mediter-

ranean was more than just a sum total of its parts; it was a dynamic process.

i d e n t i t y a n d c o e x i s t e n c e

This study reconsiders identity in the early modern world in a more ﬂuid and

complex fashion in order to both illuminate and explain Veneto-Ottoman cultural

interaction and coexistence. To accomplish this, it is necessary to move beyond

the ‘‘clash of civilizations’’ model, which surveys the relationship between Islam

and Christianity from a geopolitical and rhetorical perch on high, and instead to

analyze the lived reality microscopically and on a local, cultural level. Focusing on

a localized microcosm such as the Venetian nation reveals the experience of

Venetians and Ottomans living side by side and illuminates the complex ways

people of diverse religious, cultural, linguistic, and social backgrounds interacted

and coexisted on a communal level. By moving from the global to the local,

shutt ling ‘‘between the macroscopic and the molecular levels,’’ a more precise

picture of the real rather than the rhetorical character of everyday existence on the

"
34,"20

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

frontier materializes.∞≤∞ In order to supersede broad generalizations and categori-

zations that help organize, but may also obscure, the past, we must turn to

individuals and small groups and examine their experiences without assuming

that their relationship to a state, religion, or culture was paramount.∞≤≤

Venice’s merchant and diplomatic nation in Constantinople represents an

ideal environment for examining the nature of identity and its place in under-

standing cross-cultural contacts in the Mediterranean. The Venetian community

was one of the largest and most vibrant foreign communities in the Ottoman

capital in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Located in the inter-

stices of the Mediterranean, it is particularly well situated for studying the charac-

ter of cultural interaction and identity because of its proximity to and close deal-

ings with the diverse world of the Ottoman capital. Chronologically, the decades

from 1573 to 1645 are intriguing because they represent the longest continuous

period of peace between the Venetian and Ottoman empires, which permits an

examination of Veneto-Ottoman relations in a time not distorted by hostility.

Finally, the rich archival records surrounding the Venetian nation— including ex-

tensive notarial records, diplomatic reports and correspondence, supplemented

by travel literature and French, English, and Ottoman sources— show the physiog-

nomy and experience of this community, as well as its place within the broader

networks of early modern Constantinople.∞≤≥

The essence of my argument is really quite straightforward. First, through a

detailed study of the microculture of Venetians in Constantinople in the late six-

teenth and ﬁrst half of the seventeenth centuries, I argue that while factors such

as religion, culture, and political status all could be integral elements in construc-

tions of self and community, we must avoid the inclination to essentialize identity

into any single one of these elements. Early modern identity was multilayered,

multivalent, and composite. It was also not an apprehendable object, the sum

total of its constituent parts, but rather a dynamic process. This is evidenced both

in the Venetian nation, with its multiple layers of o≈cial and uno≈cial elements

and its porous boundaries, and in the self-fashioning of Jews, renegades, mer-

chants, and subjects who inhabited the broader world of Constantinople.

Second, I challenge the conﬂictual model of Veneto-Ottoman relations and

suggest instead a more sophisticated understanding of the intersection of cul-

tures. Although dissonance and strife were certainly part of this relationship,

coexistence and cooperation were more common. The Orientalist image of a

binary Mediterranean is unsatisfactory because it is rooted less in quotidian expe-

rience than in the descriptive vituperativeness of the era’s rhetoric, which easily

lends itself to ‘‘generalizations and striking metaphors’’ that oversimplify in-

"
35,"i n t r o d u c t i o n

21

ﬁnitely more complex realities.∞≤∂ Overreliance on certain genres of literary docu-

ments, from which broad postulates about Veneto-Ottoman relations have been

drawn, has produced what Stephen Greenblatt calls the ‘‘theoretical mistake

and . . . practical blunder [of ] collaps[ing] the distinction between representation

and reality.’’∞≤∑ While there clearly is a relationship, the two must not be conﬂated.

Rhetorical literature allows us to glimpse perceptions of the other from both

Christian and Muslim perspectives, but it leaves open for speculation the ques-

tion of whether this matched actual experience. Perhaps an Italian saying ex-

presses succinct ly the concept I am suggesting: tra il dire e il fare c’è di mezzo il

mare (the chasm between words and actions is as large as the sea). Ottomans and

Venetians did ﬁnd ways to inhabit the same world in relative peace; the challenge

is to explain this reality.

A more complex understanding of both identity and the interaction of cul-

tures in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can help us understand Veneto-

Ottoman coexistence. Early modern identity was not ‘‘a cultural trap’’ of totalizing

categories but rather an ongoing process of fashioning and refashioning. Pre-

modern societies were not characterized by rigid, invariable, or inviolable pat-

terns of association and identity; rather barriers that have often been ‘‘regarded as

watertight and impassible’’ were much more permeable and porous than imag-

ined.∞≤∏ When viewed in this light, the experience of Venetians in Constantinople

seems less exceptional and may even suggest some broader insights into identity

and cultural interaction in the early modern world.

This argument is developed in three stages. The ﬁrst part examines the struc-

ture and institutions of the Venetian nation in Constantinople and suggests the

need for a more ample, ﬂuid view of community and communal identity. One of

the core questions is who was a Venetian. Chapter 1 looks at what I have termed

the o≈cial nation— the bailo, his famiglia, and the institutions of the nation.

Chapter 2 examines the other major component of the o≈cial nation, the mer-

chants, suggesting that the label of merchant of Venice masked a much more

unstable and intricate reality than this seemingly clear-cut rubric implies. Chap-

ter 3 considers the community on the periphery of the o≈cial core, the uno≈cial

nation. This largest component of the broader Venetian community was made up

of men and women in Constantinople without the express endorsement of the

Venetian state yet who functioned within and were considered an integral part of

the nation.

Chapters 4 and 5 build on the ﬁrst chapter’s problematization of the concepts of

community and nation and address the question of identity in the early modern

era. Through an examination of Jews, Christian renegades, but also merchants,

patricians and the community of Latin-rite Ottomans, these chapters challenge

the structuralist, essentialized image of identity as based on religion and / or na-

tion and instead attempt to show that early modern identity was a composite of

many factors, as well as a ﬂuid process of deﬁnition and redeﬁnition.

Chapter 6 attempts to connect the discussions of nation and identity to the

issues of cultural exchange and coexistence. Freed from a ﬁxed model of identity, I

argue that Venetians and Ottomans interacted in a more complex and varied

fashion than the binary, clash of cultures model permits. Coexistence between

Muslim and Christian, Venetian and Ottoman, was possible, and even common

on the Mediterranean frontier, and this was facilitated by the ﬂuidity of both

individual and collective identity.

n am e s a n d d a t e s

Standardizing dates is a tricky proposition when studying the early modern

Mediterranean. In Venice, for example, the year began not on January 1, but on

March 1. Thus in most cases, a Venetian document dated ‘‘February 23, 1588

(more veneto)’’ would on a modern calendar refer to February 23, 1589. I have

elected to record dates as they are indicated in the original documents, with MV

following the year to indicate that the date is based on the Venetian calendar year,

or the more veneto. In the case of the Turkish and Jewish worlds, each of which has

its own calendrical traditions, I have simply placed the equivalent Christian year

in parentheses.

The Venetian Nation

in Constantinople

The foundations of the Venetian trading and diplomatic nation in Constan-

tinople date to the earliest days of La Serenissima. Initially a minor outpost in

Italy, Venice increasingly became a signiﬁcant political and commercial partner of

the Byzantines. In 1082, in recognition of its assistance against the Normans, the

Emperor Alexius I Comenus granted Venice special customs privileges, as well as

a quarter in the city to facilitate the trade of Venetian merchants who had already

long been established in the Byzantine capital. The subsequent centuries, par-

ticularly following the fourth crusade, saw the Venetian colony in Constantinople

grow to perhaps over ten thousand inhabitants, ‘‘a veritable litt le republic, orga-

nized in the image of ’’ the dominante. Indeed, its head, the bailo, became one of

the most powerful men in the city and the Venetian presence a threat and disrup-

tion to the Byzantine emperors’ power. From this and other bases in its stato da

mar empire, Venice by 1400 had signiﬁcant ly weakened its chief competitors and

e√ectively dominated the trade of the eastern Mediterranean.∞

The expansion of the Ottomans transformed Venice’s position and increas-

ingly forced the city to adapt to new realities, particularly in the eastern Mediterra-

nean. At the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Venetians were forced to

transfer the bulk of their colony from its prime location within the capital city,

across the Golden Horn to the international suburb of Galata. Galata was where

the Genoese colony had been located historically, and it became the center of the

international community under Ottoman rule. Following the fall of the Byzan-

tines, Venice lost its commercial monopoly, but its merchants continued to enjoy

the favor of Mehmed the Conqueror, who granted them several lucrative privi-

"
38,"24

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

leges. This patronage came to an end in 1463, when the Republic declared war on

the sultan. Over the next ﬁfteen plus years, the Venetian presence in the Ottoman

capital dwindled to almost nothing, a pattern that would repeat itself to a degree

again in 1499, 1537, and 1570.≤ More signiﬁcant to the fortunes and status of

Venice than the temporary setbacks of these brief periods of hostility, however,

was the intentional Ottoman policy of weakening the city’s dominant position in

Mediterranean trade. Ottoman actions, combined with competition from old and

new commercial rivals, gradually eroded this monopoly after 1500, but Venice

continued to be one of the Ottomans’ most important international mercantile

partners well into the seventeenth century.≥

Though much reduced from its medieval heyday, the early modern Venetian

nation remained a vibrant, dynamic community, among the largest foreign com-

munities in Constantinople. A 1560 estimate reported ten to twelve merchant

houses in Constantinople; ﬁfty years later Simone Contarini reported that where

once there had been eighteen to twenty Venetian merchant houses, in his day

there were only ﬁve. An observer around 1625 provides a comparative context: he

put the number of merchant houses at eight or nine for each of the major trading

nations in Constantinople— the French, English, Venetian, and Ragusan.∂ The

Venetian nation was not limited to merchants, however. Its other chief raison

d’être was diplomatic, and to achieve the political objectives of its sponsoring

state, the merchants were supplemented by the members and support sta√ of the

Venetian diplomatic mission, who might have numbered between ﬁfty and one

hundred at any given time.

While scholars have tended often to focus on merchants and diplomats as the

sole constituent parts of the nation, the Venetian nation in early modern Con-

stantinople was much larger and more varied than this. Indeed, the category of

Venetian in this frontier region comprised a much more diverse collection of

individuals and groups than just traders and diplomats of the o≈cial nation. The

uno≈cial nation included many more men and women who existed on the mar-

gins of the o≈cial community. These marginal members numbered perhaps

several thousand, with the majority hailing from the islands of Venice’s stato da

mar empire. During the early modern era, then, the Venetian trading nation in

the Ottoman capital was a complex composite of individuals from widely varied

socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. It was not a static community, consist-

ing of precisely delineated individuals and groups; rather it was a dynamic entity,

a community that drew together a much wider range of persons than has been

traditionally suggested. This and the next two chapters are devoted to developing a

detailed snapshot of this variegated Venetian nation: Chapters 1 and 2 examine

Galata /Pera

the core of the o≈cial nation— the merchants and diplomats who were sanctioned

to reside in the Ottoman capital. Chapter 3 looks at the more numerous marginal

members of the community who composed the uno≈cial nation. The present

chapter considers the core institutions and individuals of the o≈cial, diplomatic

nation, the baili and their household.

The geographical center of the Venetian community in Constantinople was

the embassy, referred to by contemporaries as the bailate. Some time between the

fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the outbreak of the war of 1499, the baili

relocated to the center of the thriving port suburb of Galata. Following the war of

1537–40, the baili established a second household, outside the city walls in the

hills above Galata /Pera, called the Vigne di Pera, where they generally resided

during the summer months because it was cooler and a somewhat safer refuge

from the plague.∑ Following the war of Cyprus, the baili abandoned the residence

in Galata and moved to the Vigne di Pera property permanent ly; gradually the

embassies of other European powers followed.∏ While Girolamo Trevisan de-

scribed the house as ‘‘old, uncomfortable, [and] disordered,’’ it was, according

to Leonardo Donà, ‘‘an excellent house compared to the others in the land.’’π

The summer home was also preferable because the suburb was more tranquil

"
40,"26

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

and healthier than crowded Galata, and it provided the baili greater liberty to

move about at all hours, as Galata closed its gates at night. Another attraction of

the Vigne di Pera location, according to one observer, was that it permitted the

baili ‘‘to be more free, and to have more ease to smuggle escaped slaves and

similar.’’∫ Indeed, as a result of such abuses, in 1612– 13 a grand vizier threatened

to move all European embassies to Constantinople to keep them under closer

surveillance.Ω

If by the end of the sixteenth century the baili had transferred permanent ly to

the Vigne di Pera, most Venetian merchants continued to live within the city

limits of Galata, in close proximity to Ottoman Greek, Muslim, and Jewish mer-

chants, as well as the merchants of other European nations.∞≠ The reason the

merchants did not generally move to the suburb was that Galata was the center of

commercial life of the international merchant community, and it was closer to the

port. This was where most trade took place, as goods were bought and sold in the

loggia of Galata,∞∞ similar, as one traveler reported, to the Bourse in Antwerp or

the Exchange in London. Merchants gathered here at least twice daily. Beyond

this, there was no formal merchant house, or fondaco, for the nation such as

existed in many other Mediterranean and northern European ports.∞≤ This lack

of a commercial center was another reason the bailate functioned as the focal

point of the nation. The physical separation between the commercial and political

branches of the nation was the source of some dismay among the merchants, who

felt that the o≈cial residence was ‘‘in a place inaccessible to everyone’’ except the

bailo. They complained, ‘‘whoever wants to nourish his children needs to be near

them, because being distant one can only poorly nourish and watch over them.’’∞≥

The embassy complex in the Vigne di Pera was composed of several di√erent

buildings, surrounded by a wall. The enclosed space was large enough that the

inhabitants often gathered to ‘‘play ball’’ in the courtyard.∞∂ In the sixteenth and

seventeenth centuries, the main house was constructed of wood, as were most

buildings in Constantinople.∞∑ The bailate was divided into public and private

areas; the latter included numerous bedrooms in which the various members of

the bailo’s entourage lived, a room for the embassy’s janissaries, and a large room

for the bailo himself. The public rooms were devoted to the various functions of

the embassy. These included the chancellery, a large meeting room in which the

bailo received supplicants and guests in his o≈cial capacities, a banquet hall,

and the rooms where the so-called giovani della lingua studied to become Vene-

tian dragomans. The bailo’s numerous postal couriers lived apart, in a rundown

house in the courtyard, because of fears that they might introduce disease into the

complex.∞∏ The house had a small chapel, which Alvise Contarini described in

"
41,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

27

1636 as ‘‘collapsing in numerous places, without an altarpiece, [and] indecorous.’’

It also held a prison, had several secret passages, and was surrounded by a bal-

cony built in the 1590s.∞π

The bailate was the center of the life of the nation, the institutional and admin-

istrative focus of the community. As a result, anyone resident in or passing

through Constantinople who had any link with Venice, no matter how tenuous,

came into the ambit of the bailate. Though they lived in Galata, Venice’s merchant

Council of XII convened its regular meetings in the embassy to treat the myriad

issues that a√ected their trade. Greek-Venetian subjects from throughout the

stato da mar appeared at least annually to register their political status. Men and

women enslaved in Constantinople or exiled from Venetian lands appeared daily

in large numbers to entreat the intervention of the baili in their behalf. In addi-

tion, the bailate was a center of the international community’s lively interactions,

and it was regularly frequented by many Ottomans of diverse cultural and re-

ligious derivations. The bailo’s table was always full of guests, and the rooms of

the embassy often overﬂowed with overnight visitors.∞∫ Frequent banquets, com-

plete with party games, also attracted a large and diverse group of participants.∞Ω

The coherence and continuity of Venetian institutions, particularly those asso-

ciated with the chancellery, made them the most authoritative foreign institutions

in Constantinople. When signiﬁcant transactions or documents of importance

had to be registered, particularly when they dealt with intercourse across religious

or political boundaries, the participants had them recorded in the bailo’s notarial

volumes. When other ambassadors borrowed money, or sold goods of great value,

the a√air was registered at the Venetian chancellery. When disagreements arose

between merchants, diplomats or other elements of the international community,

the bailo often served as arbitrator. Ottoman subjects, too, regularly utilized the

services of the Venetian chancellery.

The embassy accommodated only the bailo and his famiglia. None of the mer-

chants or other members of the broader Venetian community lived in the com-

plex, or even necessarily nearby. In some parts of the Levant, merchants lived

together in a shared space, such as the two large, walled fondaci in Alexandria.

These contained storerooms and shops on the ground ﬂoor, baths, an oven, and

lodgings on the second ﬂoor, all surrounding a courtyard with pleasant gardens.≤≠

The situation in Constantinople was quite di√erent: there was no large, common

commercial complex to house merchants and their goods. Rather, merchants lived

in individual houses spread throughout Galata and maintained shops and ware-

houses in the bedestan and the caravansary.≤∞ Often these houses were rented, but

some merchants also owned houses and other immobile properties in Galata and

"
42,"28

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

the Vigne di Pera.≤≤ The merchant Marcantonio Vidali, for example, owned a piece

of land contiguous to the bailate and rented it to the baili as pasture for their

horses; another merchant, Edoardo da Gagliano, owned a house he rented to a

fellow trader.≤≥ Some of the houses had gardens where the merchants would meet

with members of the nation, as well as other European merchants and Ottoman

associates and friends.≤∂

If the embassy was at the geographical center of the Venetian community, its

human focus was the bailo. Among contemporaries, there was certainly no ques-

tion that the o≈ce of bailo in Constantinople ranked as the most important and

sensitive position in the storied Venetian diplomatic corps.≤∑ Because of the im-

portance of Venice’s relations with the Ottoman Empire, the o≈ce of bailo in

Constantinople garnered much renown for its holder and could bear signiﬁcant

fruits for the career of a Venetian patrician.≤∏ Conversely, a failure could snu√ out

a promising career and end in disgrace, even death, as in the case of Girolamo

Lippomano. When the Signoria suspected him of passing sensitive information

to the Spanish, he was recalled and killed himself (or was killed, as some alleged)

as he came into sight of Venice’s campanile.≤π

The origins of the o≈ce of bailo date to the eleventh century, and the tit le bailos

was derived from the holders’ primary function as Venice’s representatives before

the Byzantine emperor, the Basileus.≤∫ While initially their responsibilities cen-

tered primarily on the commercial a√airs of Venetian merchants throughout the

Byzantine Empire,≤Ω over time the baili came to be charged with political and

diplomatic duties as well, and eventually they became de facto ambassadors.≥≠ By

the end of the Byzantine era, the bailo had become one of the most powerful men

in Constantinople, second perhaps only to the emperor; indeed, he too wore the

imperial purple.≥∞

With the irruption of the Ottomans into the capital city, this status was irrevers-

ibly changed: no longer would Venice enjoy the dominant commercial and politi-

cal position it had during Byzantine times, and the reality of treating with the

much more powerful Ottomans created a much changed circumstance, to which

the Venetians only slowly adapted. The ﬁasco of the League of Cambrai in 1509

and subsequent events in the troubled ﬁrst decades of the sixteenth century

further served notice to Venice that the situation it faced in the Italian peninsula

and in the Mediterranean had altered signiﬁcant ly, and probably permanent ly.

Venice had clearly slipped into the second tier of European states, something that

Venetian contemporaries increasingly realized and pragmatically accepted after

the end of the second Veneto-Ottoman war in 1503.≥≤ As a result, the republic

pursued a precarious policy of nonalignment and neutrality in relationship to the

"
43,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

29

region’s chief powers, the Ottoman and the Holy Roman empires, and the Medi-

terranean point man of this policy was the bailo. Indeed, despite Venice’s weak-

ened political position and its altered status in the Porte, the bailo remained the

‘‘doyen du corps diplomatique,’’ and its mission the model on which other states

patterned their own.≥≥ Because, as one seventeenth-century observer wrote, the

Ottoman legation was ‘‘above all others full of inextricable di≈culties, requir-

ing a man of great resolution and prudence,’’ Venice wanted its best men on the

front lines.≥∂

The responsibilities of the baili were extensive. In a report to the Senate in

1564, a former bailo, Daniele Barbarigo, provided some sense of these: ‘‘In my

opinion, your Serenity does not give any charge . . . of greater importance, and of

greater travail . . . than this one [bailo]; because if a bailo wants to do his duty he

will never loaf about, as he has too much do in preventing the merchants being

mistreated, in holding audience with subjects, in meeting with those who can

make known to him new information (for which purpose one would need never

to leave the house), in addition to going to the Magniﬁcent Pa ¸sa and negotiating

important matters.≥∑

Barbarigo’s account suggests the range and burden of a bailo’s duties: another

bailo, Simone Contarini, simpliﬁed these into two principal areas: ‘‘The task of

bailo in Constantinople . . . seems to me to be contained in two o≈ces: one

ambassador, the other consul.’’≥∏ First and foremost, then, the baili were present

in the Ottoman capital to represent and protect Venetian political interests and to

preserve the status quo. Once in Constantinople they devoted the lion’s share of

their time to nurturing Veneto-Ottoman relations. This was accomplished most

often through a form of personal diplomacy wherein the baili maintained exten-

sive networks of friendship and patronage through which they were able to estab-

lish relationships with inﬂuential Ottomans in positions to beneﬁt and protect

Venetian interests. These networks were created and maintained through liberal

use of gifts, bribes, and hospitality (see chapter 6).

An important aspect of their diplomatic duties included gathering information

on Ottoman a√fairs.≥π The baili’s information came from members of the house-

hold personnel; agents in the informal Venetian spy network, which included

Venetian subjects in the Ottoman Empire, many of whom worked in the imperial

arsenal in Galata; banished men and women; the merchants with their many

connections; moles in the other foreign embassies in Constantinople; and nu-

merous individuals within the Ottoman bureaucracy itself.≥∫ Venice’s position as

the sole regular courier between Europe and the Levant provided the baili with the

opportunity to examine most of the mail from Constantinople to Europe, par-

"
44,"30

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

ticularly that of other ambassadors and to control the ﬂow of information in both

directions.≥Ω The combination of diplomacy and espionage, then, was essential to

the baili’s accomplishing their diplomatic mandate. Overly zealous information

gathering could, however, lead to a bailo’s expulsion, as happened in 1491.∂≠

The baili’s second principal task was to serve as Venice’s chief consular rep-

resentative in the Ottoman Empire,∂∞ charged with both promoting Veneto-

Ottoman trade and protecting it against potential interlopers such as the English,

the Dutch, and the Florentines.∂≤ While scholars have often ignored this commer-

cial role in favor of the diplomatic, it was an important part of every bailo’s charge

from the Signoria. In the commissions issued to them at their election, each bailo

was directed by the Senate ‘‘to recommend the merchants, and our subjects’’ to

the sultan and ‘‘not to fail in any of their necessities to give to these merchants and

our subjects every help and favor possible, as this is one of the principal reasons

for which you are sent there by us.’’∂≥ These onerous commercial tasks were litt le

appreciated by the baili, and consequent ly often neglected. As Ottaviano Bon

wrote in 1604, ‘‘This bailate is today a garden, in which the roses and ﬂowers are

the public a√airs, and the thorns and twigs are the a√airs of private subjects,

because of their ships and the contracts they make and the avanie that are brought

against them, on which it is necessary that I trouble myself every waking hour.’’∂∂

Though often averse to the task, the baili nonetheless worked hard to defend

Venice’s Levantine trade. This was done chieﬂy by ensuring that the capitulations,

which Venice renewed with every sultan, were observed. This required constant

vigilance. Both Venetian and Ottoman records are rife with complaints of infrac-

tions of the capitulations on both sides that threatened both Venetian and Otto-

man trade.∂∑ One particularly thorny issue that plagued the baili was the protec-

tion of the merchandise of Venetians and subjects who died in the Ottoman

Empire.∂∏ The baili also arbitrated disagreements within the Venetian nation, and

because of their reputation for fairness and the continuity of Venetian institutions

in the Porte, the baili were often asked to arbitrate issues involving other Euro-

pean nations, their ambassadors, and even Ottoman subjects.∂π

As Venice’s chief consular o≈cial in the Ottoman Empire, the baili’s chancel-

lery also notarized a wide variety of commercial and legal documents whose

validity was accepted throughout the Mediterranean, including in Ottoman lands.

Among these were bills of health given to ships and travelers leaving Constan-

tinople, which certiﬁed that the city had been plague-free at their departure, and

were necessary to avoid protracted quarantine time in Venice’s lazaretto.∂∫

Beyond political and commercial a√airs, matters relating to Latin-rite Chris-

tians in the Ottoman Empire occupied a signiﬁcant amount of the baili’s time.∂Ω

"
45,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

31

For centuries Venice had been the de facto protector of Latin-rite Christianity in

the stato da mar, in Ottoman territories, and in the Holy Land. The baili were also

important ﬁgures in the confraternities of Galata and were protectors of the

company of the Holy Sacrament. While holding the protectorate of Roman Ca-

tholicism in the region created many trials for the baili, it also returned certain

liturgical and honorary beneﬁts of precedence.∑≠ After 1600, however, Venice’s

position as the defender of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire was gradually

usurped by the French, who were supported by the Jesuits.∑∞

Another aspect of the baili’s religious charge was the protection and eventual

redemption of Venetians enslaved in the Ottoman Empire. While the capitula-

tions dictated that all nobles, citizens, subjects, and persons in Venetian service be

turned over immediately by Ottoman o≈cials, the reality was that once captured,

slaves were rarely released voluntarily either from private households or from

o≈cial Ottoman institutions, such as the arsenal. Obtaining freedom for these

slaves, who in 1588 were estimated to number at least 2,500, consumed much

time and treasure.∑≤ Piero Bragadin in 1525 reported having already freed sixty-

four slaves, though he hoped to free three hundred by the end of his service; forty

years later Daniele Barbarigo freed ninety slaves during his bailate, and Paolo

Contarini in 1581 obtained the release of forty-six slaves, including one Venetian

patrician. Overzealousness in carrying out this duty, however, could create trou-

ble. On at least two occasions, the sultans wrote direct ly to the doge complaining

about the actions of the baili in freeing slaves held in Constantinople and request-

ing their recall.∑≥

Freeing slaves, defending commerce, treating in the divan, the tasks of the

baili required their full energy. For men of ambition and ability, the o≈ce repre-

sented a signiﬁcant opportunity that outweighed the dangers and inconveniences

it often presented. While some avoided the challenges of defending and repre-

senting Venice’s commercial and diplomatic positions in Constantinople, more it

would appear eagerly sought the posting as an important step on their cursus

honorum. As the supreme representative, and indeed, the personiﬁcation, of the

Venetian state in the eastern Mediterranean, the patricians who were elected as

baili represented the centerpiece around which the diverse Venetian nation was

arrayed. Litt le wonder, then, that Venice’s governing bodies carefully selected

from their most accomplished and capable members those who would be able to

meet the rigors of service in the Ottoman capital.

The men elected as baili were not expected to confront their responsibilities

alone. In recognition of the unique challenges of being ambassador, consul, and

head of the large Venetian community, the Senate authorized the baili to engage a

"
46,"32

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

number of o≈cials and servants to assist them in their important missions.∑∂ The

servants and o≈cials attached to each bailo formed the rest of the o≈cial core of

the nation, and were referred to as the famiglia (though not genealogically related

in any way).

The size of the famiglia generally varied from twenty-ﬁve to thirty-ﬁve: when

Simone Contarini traveled to Constantinople in 1608, he counted thirty-four

members of his household, including a secretary, his assistant (coadiutore), an

accountant (ragionato), chaplain, doctor, majordomo (maestro di casa), ﬁve drago-

mans, six giovani della lingua, and seventeen men generically classiﬁed as ser-

vants.∑∑ While the size of the famiglia ﬂuctuated over time, there remained a clear

di√erence between the quantity of servants permitted by the Senate, ten, and the

number the baili actually retained.∑∏ Indeed, many baili complained that the

Senate did not provide them with funds su≈cient to maintain a household large

enough to both carry out their duties and to make the necessary public impres-

sion.∑π Image was especially crucial to the success of Venice’s Ottoman diplomacy,

because, as one bailo wrote, ‘‘one is unable to make oneself esteemed in that land

except by dressing richly, maintaining an honorable famiglia, . . . with these

means friendships are conserved and new ones acquired, and the Most Serene

Republic’s greatness is made known to the world.’’∑∫

The famiglia of the baili was hierarchically organized. The secretary, coadiutore,

ragionato, chaplain, doctor and barber, as well as the dragomans and the gio-

vani della lingua, made up the famiglia alta, or upper family. The famiglia bassa,

or lower family, comprised the remainder of the household— servants, pages,

squires, couriers.∑Ω

Next to the bailo, the most important member of the Venetian diplomatic

delegation was the secretary. As one Englishman in the Ottoman capital observed,

Venice did not leave alone to the baili ‘‘the manadginge of theyre busines in that

ﬁckell state, but doe euer appoynte him a clarissimo to bee his secretory, without

whom hee can doe noethinge.’’∏≠ Because of the sensitive nature of the mission in

Constantinople, the secretaries selected to accompany the baili were certainly

among the most prepared and capable members of the Venetian Ducal Chancel-

lery. They were drawn exclusively from the estate of the cittadini originari, the

citizen sub-elite immediately below the patriciate, which in 1569 e√ectively had

been closed o√ to new families in a serrata cittadinesca, similar to the great patri-

cian serrata of 1297.∏∞

The secretaries’ most important and time-consuming task was ensuring the

regular transfer of information between the baili and their numerous correspon-

dents: the Senate, the Council of Ten, and other magistracies in Venice, as well as

"
47,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

33

consuls, rectors, and other o≈cials in the stato da mar. Because of the importance

of events in Constantinople, the Senate required regular, detailed communica-

tions from its representatives to the Porte. As Cristoforo Valier observed, the

Senate desired ‘‘to be informed with frequent letters on what is happening at this

court, even if there is no news of importance.’’∏≤ Late or missing correspondence

often resulted in accusations of carelessness and negligence against the secretary,

and could adversely a√ect a career.∏≥

The volume of correspondence that passed through the Venetian chancellery

was remarkable. Over a two-year period, Vettore Bragadin sent 141 letters to the

Senate and Council of Ten, an average of ﬁve to six per month, almost all of which

were written in a complex cipher for security. These letters varied in length from a

single page to the more common ﬁve to ten pages.∏∂ In addition, during the same

period he sent many other letters to the various Levantine consulates under the

bailo’s jurisdiction, as well as to the rectors, captains, and other ministers of the

stato da mar and the Venetian armada. The most important letters had to be

copied and sent to Venice via several di√erent routes to avoid correspondence

being lost or intercepted, and copies of all letters to and from Ottoman o≈cials

were archived in the chancellery.∏∑ It is not surprising then, that secretaries com-

plained of the e√ects of this quantity of correspondence on their health: Antonio

Milledonne reportedly lost the use of one hand as a result of the ‘‘burdens of

writing’’ and so learned to write with the other.∏∏

The secretary also served as the notary for the nation, and indeed for much of

the international community in Constantinople, recording wills and last testa-

ments and notarizing commercial and o≈cial transactions of all sorts. Secretaries

played key roles in the information gathering e√orts of the embassy by screening

mail that went through the chancellery and gleaning items that could be of inter-

est to the Council of Ten and Inquisitors of State.∏π Secretaries were also regularly

called on to supplement the bailo in both his ambassadorial and consular roles.

With the passing by the mid-sixteenth century of the era of direct patrician in-

volvement in the Levantine trade, tasks that noble merchants had previously

carried out were often entrusted to secretaries. For example, when Bailo Niccolò

Barbarigo died unexpectedly in 1579, no other Venetian nobleman was present in

Constantinople to ﬁll the o≈ce temporarily, so his secretary Gabriel Cavazza acted

for seven months as de facto bailo until the Senate could elect and send a patrician

replacement.∏∫

The secretaries also regularly substituted the baili in diplomatic capacities.∏Ω In

1613, Gabriel Cavazza (the nephew of the Gabriel Cavazza who replaced Barbarigo

in 1579) was sent with the Grand Dragoman Marcantonio Borisi to Adrianople,

"

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

where the sultan had retired for the hunt, to negotiate a border issue and obtain

several commandments addressing di≈culties with Ottoman provincial o≈cials.

The baili also sent their secretaries to treat for the release of slaves, to negotiate

rivalries between the French and English ambassadors, to bear condolences to

Ottoman ministers, and to investigate suspicious individuals who appeared in

Constantinople.π≠

Recognizing the many duties of the secretary and the unique challenges of the

Ottoman mission, the Senate in 1568 decreed ‘‘that the Baili in Constantinople,

because of the multiplicity and importance of the correspondence that is required

in that o≈ce, may take with them a Coadiutore,’’ an assistant secretary. Only

the ambassadors in Rome and Constantinople were allocated this assistant. The

coadiutore performed many of the more menial, quotidian functions of the chan-

cellery, such as maintaining the notarial protocols, writing and copying corre-

spondence, and enciphering and deciphering letters.π∞

As with the secretaries, the coadiutori were drawn exclusively from the class of

cittadini originari. The majority of those who went to Constantinople were quite

young, usually aged between twenty and twenty-ﬁve. Most often they were ex-

traordinary secretaries of the Ducal Chancellery, the ﬁrst stage in a Venetian

bureaucrat’s career, and often Constantinople was their ﬁrst posting. For an aspir-

ing young man, service in the most important diplomatic post of the Republic

could be a springboard for a fruitful and successful career.π≤

Another key o≈cial was the rasonato, or accountant, whose duties centered on

the nation’s commerce. On arrival in and departure from Constantinople, Vene-

tian merchants and ships’ scribes were required to declare before the rasonato the

value of all goods and merchandise they received and shipped by both land and

sea so that the duties owed to Venice, the cottimi et bailaggi, could be computed.π≥

The rasonato also kept the embassy’s ﬁnancial records, including the customs

books and an account book of the embassy’s day-to-day expenditures from which

a quarterly report was compiled and sent to Venice. At the end of the bailo’s term

the rasonato was required to present the embassy’s account books for an audit in

Venice by the Proveditori del cottimo di londra.π∂ The rasonato also coordinated the

embassy’s mail service. Another important task of the rasonato was issuing letters

of credit to facilitate the transfer of large sums of money safely over long dis-

tances.π∑ Finally, as one of the chief Venetian o≈cials in Constantinople, the

rasonato might be sent to represent the bailo before Ottoman dignitaries.π∏

The secretary, his coadiutore, and the rasonato were the key administrative

ﬁgures in the bailo’s famiglia. They fulﬁlled crucial administrative tasks and were

essential to the e√ective function of the embassy in both its diplomatic and its

"
49,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

35

consular duties. They were joined by several other persons in supporting roles.

The chaplain was charged with the spiritual well-being of the bailo’s household, a

task deemed of great import in the spiritually and morally dangerous Ottoman

Empire. He celebrated mass daily for the bailo and the famiglia in the small chapel

located within the embassy, which spared them the long trip to the main Latin-rite

church of San Francesco in Galata, where the personnel of the diplomatic mis-

sions and Ottoman Latin-rite subjects usually heard mass on Sundays and feast

days.ππ As was the case with the secretaries, favorite chaplains followed patricians

as they moved from post to post and often served as personal spiritual adviser to a

Venetian patrician throughout his career.

Another valued support ﬁgure was the medico di casa, or house physician.π∫

Originally the bailo was accompanied by a barber who could only perform simple

medical procedures. The barber was supplemented by Ottoman physicians, in-

variably Jews, who were renowned for both their medical skills and their political

connections.πΩ The most famous Jewish physician / diplomat, Solomon Ashke-

nazi, in 1573 played a key role in negotiating Venice’s separate peace following

Lepanto. Born in Udine, and thus technically a subject of Venice, Ashkenazi

served as medico di casa to all Venetian baili and ambassadors until his death in

1583.∫≠ At his death, Ashkenazi was replaced, on the recommendation of many

important Ottomans, by the Portuguese Marrano, David Valentino. Valentino’s

and Ashkenazi’s political connections, more than their medical services, were

what led the Senate to retain them, but these activities left litt le time for actual

medical attention to the diplomatic mission. This, combined with the scandal of a

Jew caring for Christians and the death from plague of Bailo Vicenzo Gradenigo

and most of his famiglia, moved the Senate in 1600 to provide the embassy with

its own Christian physician.∫∞

The ﬁnal members of the famiglia alta were in many ways perhaps the most

important. The dragomans (derived from the Persian terdjuman)∫≤ and their pro-

tégés, the giovani di lingua, ﬁlled a role crucial to the functioning and success of

the Venetian mission in the multilingual world of early modern Constantinople.

Because of the regular rotations characteristic of Venice’s diplomatic corps, and

despite the recommendation of former bailo Marino Cavalli that diplomats posted

to the Ottoman Empire ‘‘need to know the Slavic, Greek, and Turkish languages,

otherwise [they] are like mutes,’’∫≥ none of the baili in the period after Lepanto had

any formal knowledge of the Ottoman language spoken in the Porte. In the early

sixteenth century, Andrea Gritti appears to have had some command of the lan-

guage, a result of his extended residence in Constantinople as a young merchant,

but he was entirely exceptional.∫∂ Although the italianate lingua franca was widely

"
50,"36

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

used in the eastern Mediterranean, and indeed in much of Europe,∫∑ for formal

negotiations and everyday activities, the baili were entirely dependent on their

dragomans’ mastery of the Ottoman idiom.

This dependence grew as the mission expanded over the course of the six-

teenth and seventeenth centuries. In 1500 there was only one dragoman; by 1530

there were two; and from the war of 1537 to Lepanto there were consistent ly three

dragomans serving Venice.∫∏ After Lepanto, the number increased in short order

to six, and by the time of Alvise Contarini’s mission in the mid-1630s, seven

dragomans were in Venice’s service.∫π

The di√erent dragomans served in a variety of tasks. The grand dragoman was

charged with treating the most important issues of state and spent his days in the

divan and the palaces of the members of the Ottoman hierarchy. He was the face

of Venice in the halls of Ottoman power as the baili spent most of their time in the

bailate and only occasionally made the long trip across the horn to Constan-

tinople. An eighteenth-century bailo described the ideal grand dragoman thus:

‘‘The tongue that speaks, the ear that hears, the eye that sees, the hand that gives,

the spirit that acts, and on whom life and the success of every negotiation may

depend.’’∫∫ The ‘‘litt le dragoman’’ spent his days in the port and merchant loggia

of Galata and was charged with interpreting for the merchants and the ragionato

and dealing with any commercial matters involving Ottoman o≈cials and mag-

istracies. The dragomano di strada was the traveling dragoman, who accompanied

the baili on their trips to and from Constantinople and was sent on the road to

treat matters related to borders and other local diplomatic issues.∫Ω Another drag-

oman was always expected to be in the bailate to assist in the myriad linguistic

issues that arose daily. The remaining dragomans were usually younger appren-

tices who supplemented and assisted the four chief men.Ω≠

Though key members of any bailo’s famiglia, the dragomans were in many

ways unique. Most of them did not live in the bailate; rather they had homes in the

Vigne di Pera in reasonable proximity to the embassy complex.Ω∞ In contrast to

most other members of the bailo’s team, they were permanent residents of Con-

stantinople, and indeed almost all of them were subjects not of Venice but of the

Ottoman Empire. Indeed, Venice’s dragomans, whether Ottoman or Venetian

subjects, were invariably among the most important and inﬂuential members of

the Latin-rite community.Ω≤ This was a source of endless concern and constant

complaints to the Senate by the baili, who feared that their most intimate discus-

sions might be compromised, or that the dragomans might be intimidated be-

cause of their status and their exposed position as Ottoman subjects. Another

common concern was linguistic ineptitude. It was endlessly frustrating for Ven-

"
51,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

37

ice’s most e√ective diplomats to be e√ectively rendered mute in their dealings at

the Ottoman Porte.Ω≥ These concerns are laid out clearly in a 1594 assessment by

Bailo Marco Venier: ‘‘The quality of the dragomans [who are] subjects of this

Empire is such that having to depend in their jobs and in their everyday lives on

those who have tyrannical authority [over them], they often adapt their interpreta-

tions more to the avarice and arrogance of the Turks than to the reputation and

beneﬁt of the a√airs of [Venice], which creates indignity and burdens for the

[ambassadors and baili] who cannot trust their translations.’’Ω∂

To free the baili from their dependence on non-Venetian dragomans, in 1551

the Senate conceived a program to train young men in eastern languages, so as to

maintain a pool of loyal Venetian citizens and subjects who could ﬁll this most

important task and to free the baili from their dependence on foreign drago-

mans. This program established the Venetian embassy’s famous and much cop-

ied school for giovani di lingua, or language apprentices.Ω∑ The decree of the

Senate that established the program also stated its raison d’être: ‘‘it being impor-

tant to have in this o≈ce persons who are no less e√ective than faithful.’’ A local

teacher was retained to teach the young men, who lived in the bailate and ate at

the bailo’s table. Boys accepted into the program were to stay in the Ottoman

capital for ﬁve years.Ω∏ The initial number of giovani di lingua was set at two, but

that number quickly expanded so that by 1625 there were regularly more than ten

young men studying in the school at any given time who were dependent on

Venetian support.

While the embassy language school proved successful in producing genera-

tions of dragomans, it failed in its goal to free Venice from dependency on non-

Venetian dragomans. Into the early seventeenth century several citizen boys par-

ticipated in the program, but as a result of several high proﬁle cases in which boys

converted to Islam, as well as concerns over health threats, Venetian citizen par-

ents seem to have become more reluctant to send their sons to Constantinople.Ωπ

Increasingly, then, the program served the sons of Ottoman Latin-rite subjects,

especially those of the Ottoman dragomans in Venetian service who saw the

giovani della lingua program as a way to insert their sons into Venetian service and

thus e√ectively make their lucrative positions hereditary.

The secretary, coadiutore, rasonato, chaplain, and physician, along with the

dragomans and giovani della lingua, made up the famiglia alta. Much more nu-

merous, but also more anonymous in the records, was the famiglia bassa.

The most important ﬁgure in the famiglia bassa was the maestro di casa, the

majordomo. As one ambassador wrote, ‘‘He is the overseer of all and . . . like the

counterweight of a clock makes all the gears move, so the diligence of this man,

"
52,"38

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

the prudence, his modesty and severity ensures that everyone carries out their

o≈ces.’’Ω∫ The majordomo oversaw the provisioning, sta≈ng, and maintenance

of the physical structures of the bailo’s household. He traveled with the new bailo

from Venice, always preceding the main party to arrange for accommodations

and to prepare the bailate for the ceremonial procession and feast that was held at

the arrival of every bailo in Constantinople.ΩΩ Evidence of the majordomo’s impor-

tance was the location of his bedroom, which direct ly adjoined the bailo’s.∞≠≠

The majordomo was direct ly responsible for the nonprofessional sta√ of the

embassy— the cooks, footmen, valets, and grooms, and was to ‘‘preserv[e] the

famiglia from disagreements and ﬁghts, . . . and not give them time to gamble or

go whoring.’’∞≠∞

Second in importance in the famiglia bassa was the cavaliere, or marshal, who

assisted the bailo in his consular and juridical duties. He was responsible for

delivering summonses and other legal communications; conducting investiga-

tions and interviewing witnesses in civil and criminal matters brought before the

bailo; ensuring the presence of witnesses subpoenaed to appear before the bailo’s

court; and discharging penalties, as far as this was possible and desirable within

the limitations imposed by Ottoman law. The cavaliere sequestered merchandise,

warehouses, homes, and other spaces that had been declared o√-limits pending

judgment by the bailo, and sold at public auction unclaimed items left in the

chancellery. Finally, he was the keeper of the o≈cial iron seal of St. Mark, used to

authenticate documents and weights and measurements.∞≠≤

The rest of the household sta√ consisted of generic servants. While the fami-

glia alta was always made up of Venetian citizens, there were no requirements

that these servants be Venetian, or even Venetian subjects. Of the seventeen

servants Simone Contarini listed in his household in 1612, eleven were Venetian

subjects, while the remainder hailed from towns in Italy, France, Armenia, and

Anatolia. The baili also retained many local people—Ottoman Greeks, and even

Muslims— to serve as cooks, footmen, valets, and grooms.∞≠≥ In addition, baili

retained gardeners and bakers for the embassy.∞≠∂ Some baili brought painters

with them to record their missions in Constantinople, and these artists were

invariably in great demand among the Ottoman elite.∞≠∑

While men constituted the bulk of the famiglia, there were occasionally a few

women who served in the bailate. A 1590 letter mentions a man from Chioggia

who had been a slave for nine years, whose wife worked in the bailate, perhaps to

earn funds for his release; another document refers to a former woman slave,

freed by the bailo, who promised to serve him until she could pay o√ the forty

ducats she had borrowed to buy her freedom.∞≠∏ Perhaps there were other women

"
53,"t h e v e n e t i a n n a t i o n i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

39

in similar situations, who never appear in the records, which rarely mention

lesser servants, male or female. On the whole, however, the famiglia was a man’s

world, and women existed only occasionally on its margins.

While most of the famiglia came from European lands, there were a number of

Ottomans who were part of the larger embassy household. The most important of

these were the dragomans and giovani della lingua, and their Ottoman-Muslim

coza, or instructor of Turkish. Next in importance were the janissaries of the casa,

or the yasakçıs. Every embassy in Constantinople had a contingent of janissaries

assigned to protect and oversee their members. Foreign ambassadors in Con-

stantinople engaged from two to eight janissaries; the Venetian baili had at least

four.∞≠π These janissaries were known among their fellow Muslims as ‘‘swine-

herds’’ for their work among inﬁdels, but it appears that generally good relations

existed between them and their charges.∞≠∫ Of the bailate’s janissaries, one was

needed to assist the merchants; one to escort the dragomans, baili, and other

o≈cials when they left the house; and at least one to be present at all times to

protect the bailate.∞≠Ω The janissaries of the casa had a variety of roles. They served

the bailo ‘‘for his gard, conservation or surety of his person, his house and family,

so as to them or none of theirs be done any wrong or injury, which if any should

attempte to doe, these janissaries have full authority for to punishe siche by

beating them with a sta√e upon their belly, buttocks, yea and sometimes under

the soles of their feet, without that any dare withstande or resist them, such is

their greate authority.’’∞∞≠ If there were a bread or grain shortage, the baili might

also send his janissaries ‘‘to gather bread with violence and authority,’’ as Lorenzo

Bernardo did 1586.∞∞∞ In an interesting blurring of jurisdiction, the janissaries

were also charged with guarding Venetian prisoners, who were held in chains in

the janissaries’ room, though this arrangement proved relatively unreliable as

prisoners regularly escaped.∞∞≤ Janissaries also occasionally served as intermedi-

aries between the bailo and his Ottoman-Muslim neighbors and others in the

Porte whom the bailo might desire to encounter outside the somewhat restrictive

conﬁnes of the divan. In addition, they were charged with protecting Venetian

merchant ships as they arrived in Galata and were unloaded at the customs house,

for which service they received a small percentage of the goods they were assigned

to protect.∞∞≥

The ﬁnal, and largest contingent of the famiglia was the portalettere, the cou-

riers of the Venetian mail service. All Venice’s couriers were Ottoman subjects,

usually from the region of Montenegro, and as one informant observed, ‘‘Though

they are poor and of very low condition and live rustically, they are all, however,

robust and strong youths, well-disposed to carry out their charge and resolute in

"
54,"40

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

defending themselves in their journeys.’’∞∞∂ Besides carrying the mail, the cou-

riers also worked in the bailate as cooks’ helpers or in other minor support

positions. They also provided numbers to ﬁll out the honor guard that accom-

panied the bailo to church and on other ceremonial occasions, dressed in livery

for the greater honor of the household.∞∞∑

Except for the occasional married dragoman, all these men physically resided

with the bailo in the complex in the Vigne di Pera. Given the size of his household

(ﬁfty to a hundred people), it is no surprise that the bailo often described supervis-

ing them as one of his greatest burdens.∞∞∏ The documents are replete with

instances of gambling, scu∆es, and thefts among household members, as well

a number of cases of moral turpitude and even several murders. These sorts

of disturbances were quite dangerous because they opened the door to poten-

tial Ottoman interference in the household’s internal a√airs, which presented a

threat to the sovereignty and authority of the bailo over his nation.

This examination of the famiglia of the Venetian baili in Constantinople gives

some suggestion of the size and diversity of the mission to the sultans. No other

European embassy in Constantinople was so large, and provided the number and

level of services as the Venetian. The baili’s diplomatic and commercial mission

required a large supporting cast of secretaries, servants, couriers, and guards. The

services the baili and their famiglia provided to the larger nation were critical to its

e√ective functioning. In addition to services, the bailo, the famiglia, and the

embassy itself provided an institutional presence and focus for the larger commu-

nity of Venetians in Constantinople. Whether merchants or diplomats, slaves or

renegades, Greeks or exiles, all who considered themselves Venetians interacted

in some fashion with the o≈cials and institutions of Venice in Constantinople.

The bailo and his famiglia, along with the merchants (who will be examined in

chapter 2), represented the core of the o≈cial Venetian nation, which is to say they

were sanctioned by the state and their presence in Ottoman lands was legally

recognized and sustained. Although they composed the core o≈cial element of

the nation, behind the seemingly homogeneous facade of the Venetian nation

existed diverse groups of individuals who identiﬁed in varying degrees with Ven-

ice. While the patrician baili and their cittadini secretaries had the closest and

clearest tie to the state, they were great ly outnumbered both in the bailate and in

the larger nation by newly minted citizens, subjects from throughout the empire,

and many non-Venetians, including Christian and Muslim Ottoman subjects.

These men, and the occasional woman, living and working together in Ottoman

capital suggest the variety and disparity of groups who identiﬁed with and func-

tioned under the aegis of the Venetian nation.

The Merchants of Venice

On the ﬁrst day of the Venetian new year, March 1, 1594, Bailo Marco Venier

convened the governing body of the merchant nation in Constantinople, the

Council of Twelve, in the great room of the embassy. In attendance were the

principal merchants of the nation, gathered to discuss a ship which had foun-

dered carrying valuable merchandise and goods belonging to many of their num-

ber. As he did at every such meeting, the bailo’s secretary Gabriel Cavazza regis-

tered a careful list of all the participants, seventeen in total: Andrea Soranzo, Piero

Bragadin, Girolamo Pianella, Edoardo da Gagliano, Pasqualino Leoni, Zuanan-

tonio Perla, Giacomo Balbi, Francesco di Niccolò, Benetto Bozza, Agostino

Agazzi, Bernardin Agazzi, Marcantonio Vidali, Zuanmaria di Ventura, Demos-

thene Carrerio, Zuanbattista Mocello, Zorzi di Gianna, Piero di Grassi, Antonio di

Cavalli.∞

This list of names, one of literally hundreds recorded in the notarial protocols

of the Venetian nation, seems at ﬁrst glance of litt le potential historical value. Yet

these names open a window onto an aspect of merchant nations which has often

been overlooked. While there is an extensive literature on the commercial ac-

tivities of medieval and early modern merchant nations, we have an incomplete

picture of the actual merchants who made up trading nations.≤ The regularity

with which lists such as Cavazza’s appear in the records of the bailate permit a

unique prosopographical reconstruction of the merchants who made up the Ve-

netian commercial nation in Constantinople.

It has generally been assumed, though not necessarily substantiated, that

trading nations were culturally homogenous, ‘‘closed ethnic and social enclaves.’’≥

"
56,"42

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Niels Steensgaard describes the merchant nation as ‘‘a society of merchants of

common origin,’’ while Frédéric Mauro writes of ‘‘an ethnology’’ of merchant

nations bound together by a common geographical provenance and a shared

culture and language.∂ A cursory examination of the merchants comprising the

Council of Twelve, however, gives a clear sense of the social, political, and cultural

diversity concealed by the label ‘‘Venetian nation.’’ The only patricians in the

group were Soranzo and Bragadin, and Soranzo was merely passing through

Constantinople at the time. Bragadin was the sole Venetian patrician trading in

the Ottoman capital in this period, and one of the few trading anywhere in the

Levant.∑ Of the sixteen remaining men, none were noble, but each was rather

variously described as a ‘‘Venetian merchant,’’ a ‘‘Venetian citizen,’’ or a ‘‘Vene-

tian Gent leman.’’ A careful study of their backgrounds, however, clearly reveals

that this categorization too is overly simplistic. While several—Pasqualino Leoni,

Zuanmaria di Ventura, Benetto Bozza—may have been born Venetian citizens,

most of their colleagues clearly came from much more diverse backgrounds.

Agostino and Bernardin Agazzi, two brothers originally from Bergamo, had just

recent ly been granted Venetian citizenship, which permitted them to trade in the

Levant. Demosthene Carrerio was also a Venetian subject, from the area of Capo

d’Istria, and was brother-in-law to Cristoforo Brutti, the recent ly deceased grand

dragoman of Venice in Constantinople.∏ Perhaps most surprising were Girolamo

Pianella and Edoardo da Gagliano, both of whom were Ottoman-Christian sub-

jects trading as Venetian merchants. Behind the list of merchants who convened

in 1594 there existed a community of traders inﬁnitely more variegated and

heterogeneous than initially meets the eye, which suggests the need to recast our

views of the composition and character of early modern merchant nations and of

merchant identity.

n o b l e m e r ch a n t s

Commerce in Venice, particularly international commerce, historically was

the perquisite of the patrician class, a right they jealously guarded because of its

fantastic worth. This system also guaranteed the patriciate’s continued economic

and political monopolization of the expanding city-state. Indeed, the state itself

organized and carefully regulated patrician trade in a protomercantilist system,

the objective being to encourage Venetian commerce and the involvement of as

many nobles as desired to participate. The emblematic merchant of Venice dur-

ing the city’s medieval golden age was like Marco Polo or Andrea Barbarigo: an

"
57,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

43

intrepid patrician working with family members, who made his fortune trading

exotic Asian goods in ports throughout the Mediterranean.π In Venice there was

never much debate over the legitimacy of noble commerce.∫

While patrician commercial investment remained signiﬁcant into the early

modern era, as our list of the merchants in the Council of XII in 1594 makes clear,

direct participation in trade progressively became the exception rather than the

rule. In e√ect, by the late sixteenth century the romanticized patrician merchant

world traveler of medieval Venice no longer existed. After Lepanto, Venetian

commerce in the Mediterranean came to be practiced not by adventuresome

patricians but almost entirely by non-noble factors and agents. The cultural ra-

tionale for this is evident in Girolamo Muzio’s 1571 work, Il gentilhuomo, in which

he wrote descriptively, rather than prescriptively, that trade ‘‘is honorable if it is

large scale . . . the gent leman must not dirty his hands with it, but administer

everything through factors.’’Ω This development was in reality already under way

well before Muzio wrote. In 1523 Sanudo reported that only four noble merchants

traded in Galata, while the rest of the nation was made up of ‘‘popular factors.’’ By

1555 there were only two nobles active in Constantinople, and after Lepanto this

number shrank even further.∞≠

The patriciate’s abandonment of its commercial roots has been depicted ‘‘with

monotonous insistence’’ as one of the central causes for the decline of Venice.∞∞

Observers since Girolamo Priuli in the early sixteenth century (who regarded the

terraferma as ‘‘a malignant tumor sucking the maritime vitality that had made

Venice great’’) have pointed to the patriciate’s renunciation of commerce as evi-

dence of a cultural and therefore commercial reorientation that led, in part at

least, to Venice’s economic decay. Birthed by the sea, and symbolically wedded to

it each year, Venetian greatness was portrayed as intimately intertwined with the

Mediterranean.∞≤ Niccolò Donà’s famous nostalgic speech to the Senate in 1610

lamented that ‘‘the nobility wants no part in trade, everything is spent on lands,

dwellings, and the pleasures of the city. He who has money to spare lends it at

interest, instead of investing in eastbound voyages.’’∞≥ Although recent years have

seen more nuanced discussions of early modern Venetian transformation rather

than decline, the image of Venice as primarily a ‘‘Maritime Republic’’ persists.∞∂

Linking Venetian decline to the end of patrician trade has obscured a more

involuted and elusive reality. While patricians more rarely traveled abroad them-

selves to trade, and invested proportionally less capital in international com-

merce, this was a transition which happened gradually throughout the sixteenth

and seventeenth centuries.∞∑ Noble entrepreneurs continued to invest their funds

"
58,"44

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

in international trade and other commercial endeavors, but instead of traveling

abroad, they contracted their business from the comfort of the Rialto in Ven-

ice. The bailate’s records include many incidents of patrician merchants trading

through factors in Constantinople, as does the archival collection, Giudici di pe-

tizion, rendimenti di conto.∞∏ An early-seventeenth-century report prepared for the

Venetian Senate, the Notta de tutti li Nobelli hanno negotio in Levante, listed eighty-

three families— including some of the most important—who still regularly in-

vested in international trade. Patrician investment in the Mediterranean trade

may also have been part ly cloaked by the use of intermediaries, as the Marquis of

Bedmar suggested: ‘‘the greater part of the business on the Rialto market is

transacted on account of noblemen, whether they are openly involved or engag-

ing in commerce under other people’s names.’’∞π

Ample evidence of patrician participation in commerce abounds: around 1600

the Venetian merchant ﬂeet included ﬁfty ships owned by nobles and another ﬁfty

belonging to cittadini.∞∫ Another new area of patrician investment was the ex-

panding market in maritime insurance, made indispensable by the threat of the

Uskoks and corsairs to Mediterranean shipping. Insurance’s high returns in this

troubled time may have made it seem a more secure investment than commerce.∞Ω

Another potential source of patrician income was government service, which was

a form of government welfare for patricians and other citizens. Ugo Tucci has

argued that expanding opportunities for government service helped extinguish

the spirit of commercial initiative. While perhaps true for some of the impover-

ished majority of the patriciate, this angle should not be exaggerated; as James

Davis’s study of the Donà family shows, political o≈ce was a poor way to obtain or

retain great wealth. In his long political career, Leonardo Donà made some small

proﬁt on his o≈ces, but the same money invested in commerce would have

provided a greater return. Indeed, Donà was probably exceptional, as most Vene-

tian nobles lost money through holding high public o≈ce, leading to the wide-

spread e√orts to avoid appointments which Donald Queller has identiﬁed.≤≠

While these other ﬁnancial options attracted some patrician ducats, the most

attractive way to diversify was investment in real estate. A lucrative and secure

investment, land was often viewed by patrician families as a form of insurance, a

safe haven for capital preservation, and a signiﬁcant source of income. Capital

investment in land holdings was nothing new: the great twelfth-century merchant

doge Sebastiano Ziani made his fortune in commerce and then invested in land,

and ﬁfteenth-century observers complained that the terraferma expansion was

leading to the abandonment of traditional patrician practices. In what one histo-

rian has apt ly described as the ‘‘land / sea dichotomy,’’ early modern Venetian

"
59,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

45

patrician investments increasingly came to be diverted in two directions: east and

west, sea and land.≤∞

The decline paradigm was for many years widely embraced, but more recent

research based on statistical as opposed to anecdotal evidence, which examines

the entire economy rather than single sectors, has pointed to an economic trans-

formation rather than regression.≤≤ In this view, patrician economic diversiﬁca-

tion represents not decline from some essentialized Venetian commercial charac-

ter, but rather a canny assessment of a continually changing economic landscape.

Given Venice’s lost hegemony in the Levantine market, the insecurity of the seas,

the declining returns from traditional investments, and the regular failures of

international merchants, as one merchant stated in 1555, ‘‘it is less bad to keep

capital at home than to put it in circulation with so many risks and without proﬁt.’’

If overall international commerce experienced a reduction, advances in other

sectors of the economy, particularly industry, and a shift of the port of Venice from

international to regional trade made up for it. Venice’s decline in absolute eco-

nomic terms, then, does not coincide with the gradual loss of its role as middle-

man between East and West over the course of the sixteenth and the ﬁrst decades

of the seventeenth centuries.≤≥

Although many, probably most, early modern Venetian patricians diversiﬁed

their investments and increasingly worked through agents, some did continue to

go to sea. Often they came from among the second tier of less wealthy and power-

ful Venetian families, such as Alessandro Magno in Egypt in 1561, or Andrea

Dandolo, who accompanied his brother-in-law, the bailo Girolamo Ferro, to Con-

stantinople. Niccolò Donà, father of the future doge Leonardo, proﬁted on several

short trips to the Greek islands for wines, cheeses, and cotton, and he lost money

on longer voyages to Syria for spices and oil in the years following Lepanto.≤∂ Still,

in the sixteenth century these men were exceptions to the emerging rule.

This transformation is evident in the merchant nation in Constantinople after

Lepanto, when only one Venetian noble merchant was in residence for any signif-

icant time. Pietro (or Piero) Bragadin was the eldest of the four sons of Zuanne di

Alvise and Beatrice di Ottaviano Grimani. Born in 1565, he died in 1614, appar-

ent ly without marrying. The family, from the Campo Russolo branch, had a long

history of involvement in the Levant: Bragadin’s great grandfather, Piero di Giro-

lamo, had been elected bailo to Constantinople in 1506, and his family still had

signiﬁcant investments in international commerce in the late sixteenth century.≤∑

Piero Bragadin was in many ways an anachronism, however, a holdover from

an earlier period in which Venetian patrician families sent their teenaged sons

abroad to gain commercial and life experience, the ﬁrst step in the cursus honorum

"

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

they followed in preparation for a life of commercial and political leadership.

Gasparo Contarini in his De Magistratibus et Republica Venetorum perpetuated

this ideal patrician upbringing, even though by its publication in 1541 such an

ideal was already exceptional. Following a formal school education, he writes, the

young patricians ‘‘shoulde apply themselves to navigation, being thereunto (as it

were) even drawen by their owne inclination and nature.’’≤∏ In the case of Piero

Bragadin, it seems clear from a letter written by his father, Zuane, that he envi-

sioned his son’s sojourn in Constantinople in the same terms, as a chance to

‘‘train’’ him for his future role in the Venetian state.≤π

Piero Bragadin ﬁrst appeared in Constantinople in July 1584, at age nineteen,

and he remained there until March 1594.≤∫ He was active in the nation both as a

merchant and a leader; as the only noble merchant, he served by default as the

nation’s vice-bailo. He was well known and moved comfortably among the high-

est echelons of the Ottoman court. The sultan’s mother, for instance, passed

communications via a servant to Bragadin, who served as her intermediary with

the baili.≤Ω Some sense of Bragadin’s character is conveyed by the laudatory dis-

patch composed by the bailo Marco Venier recommending him to the Senate

when the young man ﬁnally departed Constantinople. Venier described Bragadin

as a ‘‘person of great valor, prudence and experience in a√airs, especially regard-

ing this government, in no way inferior to any of the older or more experienced

men: he had free access to the seraglio of the King, and to that of the Queen, and

he was intimate with many Grandees of the Porte who had become friends be-

cause of the sweetness of his nature, his liberality, and because he speaks the

Turkish language with conﬁdence, as well as reading and writing it.’’≥≠

Piero was the ﬁeld representative in Constantinople of a much larger family

trading network, involving both his immediate and extended families, along the

lines of the historic Venetian fraterna, or family partnership.≥∞ The Bragadin clan

was engaged in commerce throughout the Adriatic, the Balkans, the Levant and

the Venetian terraferma. They were also signiﬁcant ly invested in shipping: Piero

bought and sold at least four ships during his time in Constantinople.≥≤ The

family traded in cereals, too: Piero sent a number of ships with Ottoman grain

throughout the stato da mar, and his father traveled the breadth of the terraferma

buying up grain. Other evidence suggests that Zuane Bragadin and his family

were ‘‘at the center of a vast tra≈c in golden cloth which from Venice ended up in

Constantinople, by way of Ragusa and Adrianople.’’ Like many other patricians,

the Bragadin also invested in insurance.≥≥ In sum, it appears that the family of

Zuane Bragadin was in line with the diversiﬁed investment strategies pursued by

"
61,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

47

their patrician contemporaries, even if Piero’s residence in Constantinople and

direct involvement in commerce was no longer representative of his estate.

In their varied business activities, the Bragadin also had extensive dealings

with Ottoman Greek, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian merchants. When a Braga-

din factor, Ludovico Ludovici failed, the Bragadin were held partially responsible,

despite their own losses, by important Ottoman Jewish and Muslim creditors,

including an inﬂuential çavu¸s. The reason was in part because Piero, known by all

as an honorable man ‘‘and especially in the imperial seraglio where his noble

conduct has always been accepted by the Queen,’’ had recommended Ludovici to

the çavu¸s, who had ‘‘trusted Ludovici on the word of Clarissimo Signor Piero

Bragadin.’’≥∂

Piero experienced ﬁrsthand the di≈culties and rewards of the life of a mer-

chant. He lost two members of his merchant household to the plague. In 1586,

Piero, a ‘‘most virtuous youth,’’ was caught up in a controversy when he was

implicated by a Muslim servant of the household’s janissaries in the murder of

two women, whose bodies were found dumped in a nearby well. The charges

were a pretext to extort money from Bragadin, and the bailo was able to get

Ottoman o≈cials to drop the case.≥∑

Although Piero Bragadin was the only patrician present in Constantinople

over an extended period of time, other nobles would appear temporarily in the city

for commercial dealings. Bragadin was occasionally joined by extended family

members, such as his cousin Giacomo and his younger brother, Polo.≥∏ In 1594,

Andrea Soranzo accompanied the new bailo Marco Venier to Constantinople

to treat some commercial issues, and three years later Zuane Foscarini passed

through Galata with two servants on his way to Poland ‘‘for his trade.’’ In 1603,

Giacomo Trevisan, ‘‘who is here for trade,’’ purchased a ship, the Bonaventura,

‘‘for a good price.’’ He was in Constantinople sporadically from 1602 to 1605 but

was much less active commercially than Bragadin.≥π

After Piero Bragadin departed Constantinople in 1594 and Giacomo Trevisan

in 1605, no Venetian noble merchant was again to trade or reside in the city for

any extended period. Bragadin’s departure represents the end of an era. While

patrician money would continue to be invested in Levantine commerce, nobles

no longer sent their sons to learn the trade of their forefathers. Many came

temporarily to observe the Ottoman state, but no more did they come for com-

merce.≥∫ Thus, a trend that had been developing throughout the sixteenth century

culminated in 1594, and from this date onward, all trade in Constantinople was

carried out by common, or cittadino, factors.≥Ω

"

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

cittadini

The void left by patricians in the Levantine trade was ﬁlled by three groups—

cittadini, subjects, and nonsubjects— though of these three, the majority of mer-

chants in Constantinople were cittadini. Already by 1550 the conﬂation of mer-

chant and cittadino was becoming apparent. As one observer describing the order

of Venetian society noted, ‘‘The nobleman employs his talents in letters or public

o≈ce, sometimes in the a√airs of Mars . . . the cittadino of lower standing either

takes up the career of government secretary or is employed in trade; the plebeian

is entirely occupied with crafts.’’∂≠

By law, participation in the Levantine trade was limited to Venetian patricians

and to the elusive group situated between the nobility and popolani, the cittadini,

or citizens. Though for much of their history, the cittadini were not a clearly

deﬁned estate in Venetian society, by the end of the sixteenth century, they had

come to be divided into two main groups: the so-called cittadini originari (citizens

by nature or birth), and citizens made (citizens by privilege or culture).∂∞ Between

1563 and 1642, the number of citizens of both varieties ﬂuctuated between 7,000

and 13,500, or approximately 5 to 10 percent of the population, compared with 3.5

to 5 percent patricians.∂≤ All citizens were not created equal, however. Contempo-

raries considered cittadini originari to be the true Venetian citizens because of

their historically close ties to the patriciate, and indeed in the sixteenth century

they were becoming an increasingly closed caste like the nobility.∂≥

The number of citizens by privilege, by contrast, was constant ly being re-

plenished; indeed, this regular in-migration was an important source of activity

and innovation in the evolving Venetian economy. A deliberation of the Maggior

consiglio in midcentury lays out quite clearly Venice’s motivations in granting

citizenship to non-Venetians: ‘‘Our ancestors have always striven to take those

measures which have seemed in the circumstances to be most necessary and vital

to the well-being of this city, . . . especially by giving the beneﬁt of Venetian

citizenship to various foreigners.’’ This policy was inspired by ‘‘the wars, because

of the shortage of inhabitants, so as to ﬁll the city for the good of trade, customs,

industry and other beneﬁts.’’∂∂

Venetian o≈cials were correct in their assessment: many non-Venetians

granted citizenship made important contributions to the prestige and wealth of

the city. Examples include the explorer John Cabot, made a citizen in 1476; Pas-

quale Spinola, a Genoese noble and merchant of oil and grain in Venice from

1560 to 1583; and Vicenzo Valgrisi, a typographer of French origins. The silk

"
63,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

49

weavers guild by the ﬁfteenth century was dominated by men from Bergamo, a

situation that continued into the next century. After the sack of Antwerp in 1576

and the Spanish blockade of Scheldt in 1585, wealthy Dutch merchants also set-

t led in the lagoon.∂∑

During the period under examination, it would appear that few cittadini ori-

ginari were active as merchants in the nation in Constantinople. It is di≈cult to

say this with surety, however, because Venetian chancellery records in Constan-

tinople identify individuals as cittadini veneziani, but do not clearly distinguish

whether these were citizens by privilege or by birth. A second problem is that the

laws that would lead to the ‘‘crystallization’’ of Venice’s social order into ‘‘precise

categories—nobles, cittadini originari, citizens by privilege, subjects, foreigners,’’

were only gradually being worked out between 1569 and 1583. While we cannot

say with certainty whether any cittadini originari traded in Constantinople in the

years immediately preceding and following Lepanto, after 1590 it seems clear that

they, just as the patricians, were almost entirely uninvolved in direct commercial

dealings in the Ottoman capital. Increasingly, they were engaged more as bu-

reaucrats in the state administration and as rentiers than as merchants.∂∏

The majority of the trading nation’s merchants fell under the second rubric,

citizens made. The requirements for Venetian citizenship were relatively simple,

if time-consuming: there was a residency and a taxation element. Two levels of

citizenship were possible, de intus and de intus et extra. In the former case, an

individual was required to live in Venice and pay taxes for ﬁfteen years; de intus et

extra citizens had to be resident and pay taxes for twenty-ﬁve years. Another way

to acquire de intus status was to marry a Venetian woman and pay taxes for eight

years.∂π De intus status opened up certain avenues not available to noncitizens and

ensured the new citizen a lower tax rate than foreigners paid. To participate in the

Levantine trade, however, a merchant needed to have de intus et extra status,

which allowed him to enjoy the protection and ﬁnancial assistance reserved for

members of the Venetian nation.∂∫

Obtaining citizenship was an important step on the path to economic advance-

ment and social acceptance in Venice, as well as assimilation into the elite fabric

of the city. Despite changing patrician and cittadini originari attitudes toward

commerce, large-scale merchants still generally enjoyed respect and a privileged

status in early modern Venetian society. This is evident in the temporary opening

of the patriciate to citizens who were able to buy nobility during the economic and

political problems of the mid-seventeenth century. Of the 121 families who bought

nobility between 1646 and 1718, seventy-two were engaged in commerce. A re-

vealing statistic is that of these seventy-two families, twenty-three originated in

"
64,"50

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

the region of Bergamo, almost 50 percent more than the number of merchant

families from Venice proper who were admitted into the patriciate.∂Ω

The reason for this conspicuous Bergamasque contingent is that the largest

number of applications for Venetian citizenship came from the terraferma, espe-

cially the rugged areas around Brescia and Bergamo. Because of the challenges of

eking out an existence in this region, its subjects were declared a ‘‘nation privi-

legiata’’ and granted a fast-track to citizenship in 1525, and many men from the

region became important merchants and industrialists in Venice. Among these

were the jewel merchant Salomon Rigola; the Zois brothers, who were merchants

and cloth manufacturers; and Cesare Federici, a jewel merchant who traveled to

Malacca and Burma early in his career and used the capital gained in this enter-

prise to fund many Levantine commercial activities.∑≠ Matteo Bandello wrote,

with only a degree of hyperbole, ‘‘there exists no place in the world, however

distant or remote, where there is not a Bergamasque doing business.’’∑∞

Men from the region of Bergamo were also disproportionately represented in

the Venetian nation in Constantinople as new citizens and citizens in the making;

indeed some of the most active traders came from this region. Among these were

the Agazzi brothers, Agostin and Bernardin quondam Lorenzo, who ﬁrst ap-

peared in Constantinople in early 1594. They sett led in a house in Galata, just a

few months after having been granted de intus et extra citizenship by the Senate

upon the recommendation of the V Savii (the board of trade charged with protect-

ing and encouraging Venetian commerce), who described them as ‘‘merchants

with much trade and of good fame.’’∑≤ While the granting of full citizenship

should have been the necessary prerequisite to the Agazzi becoming involved in

the Levantine trade, both brothers had been active in the Levant since at least

1588, several years before they obtained o≈cial sanction— a practice that was

technically illegal but quite common. The brothers left the Levant in 1600 be-

cause of di≈culties with an Ottoman o≈cial they represented commercially, but

both remained active in international trade as late as 1637.∑≥

After acquiring citizenship, the Agazzi quickly came to play an important role

in the nation: in 1595 Bernardin was elected one of two merchants charged with

defending Venetian commerce and representing the merchants before Ottoman

magistracies in cases where they were ‘‘mistreated’’ or ‘‘tyrannized’’ by the sul-

tan’s o≈cials. In 1598 Agostino was elected to the highest position among the

merchants, capo dei mercanti. The brothers also achieved important posts in the

Latin-rite religious community of Galata; in 1597, for example, Bernardin was

elected a guardian of the church of San Francesco.∑∂

The Agazzi dealt in a wide range of goods, including relics, such as the ‘‘an-

"
65,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

51

cient e≈gy of Our Lady in the Greek style ﬁnished in silver,’’ which they pur-

chased in 1597 for 5600 akçe. Their main trade, however, was in jewels, precious

stones, and metals. At the time of their abrupt departure from Constantinople,

the goods in their possession were valued at almost 200,000 ducats. They repre-

sented and traded with many merchants in Venice but seem to have worked

especially with a group of immigrant Dutch.∑∑ Their commercial endeavors were

successful enough that in 1593 they purchased a large ship to use in their Levan-

tine trade, and another several years later, which, though Ottoman in construc-

tion, was granted Venetian status because of the shortage of native ships.∑∏

One of the reasons for the Agazzi’s success was their extensive trade with

Ottoman-Muslims. Abdi Çelebi, for example, traded with Agostino Agazzi in

Silivri, on the Sea of Marmora, where he entrusted Agazzi as his representative in

a shipping dispute with several merchants. The Agazzi also traded with and for

some important ﬁgures in the Ottoman court, including several çavu¸ses—Hamza

A ˘ga and Ahmed A ˘ga— and Mustafa Bey, an intimate of the grand vizier.∑π This

involvement with Ottoman merchants and o≈cials was probably due to one or

both of the brothers being able to speak some Turkish.∑∫ While these dealings

were quite lucrative for the Agazzi and their partners, they also proved to be a

source of di≈culty and even danger, which ultimately forced the brothers to leave

the Ottoman capital permanent ly.

Soon after their arrival in Constantinople, the Agazzi entered into an agree-

ment with an inﬂuential Ottoman o≈cial, Ali who was a ˘ga of the Janissaries, and

a protégé of Gazanfer A ˘ga, a Venetian renegade. Ali A ˘ga provided the Agazzi with

an initial investment of 23,872 ducats to manage on his behalf. As part of his

investment they purchased a ship, the Santa Maria et San Francesco. The invest-

ments did not turn out well, and the Agazzi returned only 8,000 ducats on the

investment. Not surprisingly, Ali A ˘ga was infuriated and insisted that his initial

investment be returned, threatening both the Agazzi and the bailo if he was not

reimbursed.∑Ω It was this dispute that impelled the Agazzi to ﬂee Constantinople

because of fears that Ali A ˘ga would assault their house. They left behind, as

Bernardin described it, ‘‘great amounts of goods . . . [and] the trade of this house

progressing so well with all my e√orts in the course of my youth the past eleven

years . . . from which I had been able to hope for much honor and proﬁt.’’∏≠

The ﬂight of the Agazzi created a serious political incident that threatened

Veneto-Ottoman relations for a time. Bailo Agostino Nani eventually resolved the

a√air, but not without great e√ort and expense, and somewhat begrudgingly. He

observed: ‘‘I will not fail to help in this di≈cult negotiation especially because of

the interest that many nobles and others have in it, even though the Agazzi would

"
66,"52

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

deserve punishment rather than protection as against the laws that expressly

prohibit them entirely [from making] commercial companies, or even trading

with the principal Ministers of the Porte, they have placed in danger all the capital

of their principals.’’∏∞ While the Ali A ˘ga controversy forced both brothers to ﬂee

Constantinople, and created serious problems for them with Venetian o≈cials,

this proved only a temporary interlude. Both remained active in the Levantine

trade in subsequent decades, administering their fortune from their home in the

parish of San Cassan, neighbors to many other important Levantine merchants.∏≤

The Agazzi, then, are a classic example of the new Venetian merchant, the citizen

made, who came to control the bulk of the trade with Constantinople. And they

were by no means unique: we could examine Iseppo and Antonio Albrici, the

Zois brothers of Bergamo and many others who followed similar paths in becom-

ing the most important Venetian citizen merchants in Constantinople.

v e n e t i a n s u b j e c t s , o t t om a n s u b j e c t s , a n d o th e r s

If patricians and cittadini originari made up a small minority and citizens

constituted the majority, it still remains to establish the identity of the remaining

traders of the merchant nation in Constantinople. In an inﬂuential essay on early

modern Venetian commerce, a respected historian of Venice categorically states

that ‘‘all foreigners were rigorously excluded’’ from the Levantine trade. This is

only true in the sense that Venetian magistracies created numerous laws that

attempted to defend the monopoly citizens and patricians enjoyed in this trade.∏≥

In practice, many men who had not been approved as Venetian citizens partici-

pated; indeed, in Constantinople at times their numbers rivaled those of the

legally recognized citizen merchants. These men came from a variety of back-

grounds: most were Venetian subjects, either from the terraferma or the stato da

mar, but some non-Venetians and even Ottoman subjects also traded under the

aegis of the nation. While forbidden by law, they traded in Constantinople with

the tacit recognition and the open acceptance of the o≈cial nation.

The majority of these noncitizen traders came from the Venetian Greek is-

lands, especially Candia, and Venice and its o≈cials in Constantinople regu-

larly ignored the activities of this group. Candia at the end of the sixteenth cen-

tury underwent a signiﬁcant economic upsurge, and one of its major out lets

was the Ottoman Empire. Giovanni Moro wrote in 1600 that Candia, which was

‘‘in the jaws’’ of the Ottomans, had much more trade with Constantinople than

with Venice; this evidence would support one scholar’s recent contention that

Cretan international trade diminished in this period and was supplanted by a

"
67,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

53

regional trade nexus between Constantinople, Candia, Egypt, and Venice.∏∂ Phane

Mauroeide has compiled a series of tables showing the shipping activity of Greek-

Venetian subjects in Galata from 1580 to 1599. In this twenty year period, she

ﬁnds that on average 14.8 ships with connections to the Greek-Venetian islands

docked in the port of Galata every year.∏∑ Given the amounts of contraband that

circulated between Venetian and Ottoman Greek territories, the actual number of

ships and value of goods involved in this trade was likely much higher.∏∏

The most lucrative Candiot commercial product was wine. Cretan wines—

malvasia, muscatels, sweet wines—were renowned and traded as far aﬁeld as

England, Flanders, Spain, and Portugal. Niccolò Barbarigo in 1578 wrote ‘‘It is

normal for 1000, 1200 and even 1500 barrels of Candiot wine to come here to

Constantinople every year, and the major part of this, perhaps two-thirds, is char-
tered for the port of DSile in the Black Sea, whence it is put on carts and goes to

Poland.’’∏π The troubled times at the end of the sixteenth century made the Black

Sea passage often dangerous, and in 1592 several Candiot merchants petitioned

the Senate to establish a more secure route through the Friuli.∏∫ Describing this

commerce as regional perhaps is inaccurate: while Cretans may have been sup-

planted in the trade with western Europe and especially England, they continued

to be active throughout the eastern Mediterranean, into the Black Sea, and even

further north. To encourage and defend this Cretan eastern trade, in 1592 a

Genoese physician was elected consul in Tana and Ka√a, where many Candiot and

Venetian merchants were actively trading for morone, caviar and other goods.∏Ω

Besides these large scale wine merchants, many Cretans came to Constan-

tinople in small boats loaded down with lemons, olives, and oil which were all

highly sought after on the Ottoman market because of their quality. Other lucra-

tive Cretan exports to Ottoman territories were cheeses, oil, cotton, honey, wax,

raisins, fruit and citrus juices: it was reported that the Ottoman capital annually

consumed 3–4,000 barrels of orange and lemon juices imported from Candia.

This trade was important not only to the Ottomans but also to the baili, who

collected a variety of duties on the merchandise of Candiot traders. Given the

reduced ﬂow of Venetian commerce through Constantinople, these duties were

an important source of income.π≠

The majority of these Greek subject traders remained on the periphery of the

o≈cial nation. They generally did not participate in the governance and other

formal activities of the nation, but they did enjoy the protection of the baili. In

some instances, however, Greek subjects did participate as members of the o≈-

cial nation. Leonin Servo, for example, was a Venetian subject from Candia who

was active in Constantinople in the decades prior to and after Lepanto. In his role

"
68,"54

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

as a factor for many Cretans in the Ottoman capital, Servo became very wealthy.

Indeed, his wealth and commercial activities led him to acquire a reputation

among Venetian o≈cials for arrogance and as a troublemaker. Yet he was per-

mitted to participate in the workings of the nation, voted in meetings of the

Council of Twelve and traded as a Venetian.π∞

Besides the Greeks, subjects of Venice’s terraferma were also present in Con-

stantinople, and some of them traded as Venetian merchants without o≈cial

status. The policy seems to have been one of ‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell’’: when sanc-

tioned merchants in Venice requested permission to allow non-Venetians to rep-

resent them in Constantinople, the V Savii and Senate opposed it, though increas-

ingly not without vigorous debate as Venice’s commercial situation deteriorated.

The fear among these magistracies was that by relaxing the legal requirements for

trading in the Levant, commerce would pass from the hands of legitimate patri-

cian and citizen merchants to foreign interlopers, who would take over the entire

trade and block out Venetians, to the detriment of the city and its citizens. This

issue arose regularly: it was addressed in 1524, 1536, and 1603, with always the

same negative response. The issue arose again in 1610 when Paolo Santorini

proposed to allow foreigners to trade as Venetians without the residency and tax

requirements of citizenship. Because of the great ly reduced commercial position

of Venice, this proposal was entertained more seriously as a legitimate innovation

to rescue Venice’s failing fortunes; in the end, however, it too was rejected.π≤

This o≈cial hesitance did not prevent unsanctioned merchants in Constan-

tinople from trading openly as Venetians. In 1597 several merchants in Venice

proposed to send Ludovico di Damiani, a subject born in Salò, near Brescia, who

had married a Venetian and lived in Venice for twenty-one years, to open a ‘‘house

of trade in Pera.’’ They did not even request that he be exempted from paying the

higher duties of non-Venetians, and they openly acknowledged that he was ‘‘a

foreigner.’’ The V Savii opposed this proposal because ‘‘it is not permitted that any

except cittadini originari, or those made [citizens] by privilege . . . , may navigate or

trade in the Levant.’’ Thus, though Damiani was a subject, he did not yet meet the

requirements for citizenship, and the V Savii opposed the idea as a ‘‘terrible

innovation.’’ Despite this ruling, ﬁve months later Damiani was in Constan-

tinople, and remained there until 1600, trading with the nation, participating in

the Council of Twelve, and in short functioning as a regular Venetian merchant,

even though he had been denied o≈cial sanction. Finally, in 1604 Damiani, citing

his long residency, his marriage to a Venetian and his contributions to the city’s

trade and customs, requested and received de intus et extra citizenship.π≥

Damiani’s experience was quite common: a subject from the mainland would

"
69,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

55

sett le in Venice and commence trading in the Levant before having fulﬁlled the

residency and ﬁnancial requirements necessary for citizenship. Instead of being

punished, he would subsequent ly receive citizenship, ironically based in part on

the success of his technically illegal commercial enterprises. In 1564, Marcan-

tonio Stanga, as part of his request for full citizenship, emphasized that he had

lived in Venice and traded in Constantinople and Syria as a factor for many years

and had paid many taxes that beneﬁted Venice’s co√ers, ‘‘and in Constantinople

he had also readily served in [times of ] public need, as is demonstrated by diverse

statements from baili and consuls.’’π∂ Even though he did not meet the residency

requirements, and had by his own admission traded illegally in the Levant for

years, the V Savii nonetheless recommended him for citizenship. The Agazzi

brothers were in a similar situation; they reported that they had traded for some

time in the Levant prior to fulﬁlling the residency requirement, which was widely

known throughout Venice. Notwithstanding, the V Savii recommended them

unequivocally as taxpaying ‘‘merchants with much trade, and good reputation.’’

Lorenzo Girardi used the same logic, and because he had lived in the city forty

years, he too was recommended.π∑ These are but a few of the many examples of

what seems clearly to have been a common practice that Venetian o≈cials did

litt le to stop. Indeed, despite the repetitive legislation to the contrary, Venetian

magistracies tacit ly accepted, and even rewarded, merchants who, though tech-

nically acting illegally, brought commerce and income to the city.

To further complicate the notions of nation and what it meant to be a Venetian

merchant, in the years after Lepanto, unsanctioned Venetian subjects trading in

the Levant were joined by a number of nonsubjects who also enjoyed the protec-

tion of the nation, and beneﬁted it and the sponsoring city’s co√ers in a time

of commercial transition. One example is Girolamo Pianella, a merchant active

in the Levantine jewel and cloth trade with several of Venice’s most prominent

noble merchants, including members of the patrician Sanudo clan and important

Ragusan o≈cials.π∏ From 1590 until at least 1607, Pianella was in Constantinople

openly and actively trading in the nation as a Venetian merchant.ππ He partici-

pated often in the Council of Twelve, and indeed was elected on several occasions

to important positions of responsibility. In 1596 he and Edoardo Gagliano were

elected procuratori to deal with issues related to the failure of Ludovico Ludovici

(interestingly, all three men—Pianella, Gagliano and Ludovici—were acknowl-

edged non-Venetians openly trading as part of the nation). The next year, based no

doubt on his service in the Ludovici case, when the merchants reorganized the

nation and created new positions of leadership, Pianella was elected nearly unani-

mously by the council as the ﬁrst assistant to the capo dei mercanti.π∫

"
70,"56

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

What is striking about Pianella is that despite his long activity and leadership

in the Venetian nation, and his representation of important patrician families, he

was not a Venetian citizen or even subject. Rather, he was, as Bailo Girolamo

Lippomano described him somewhat paradoxically, ‘‘Girolamo Pianella, Venetian

merchant, and haracgüzar of the Grand Lord’’ (that is, a tax-paying, non-Muslim

Ottoman subject). Such a statement clearly indicates that the baili were aware of

Pianella’s schizophrenic situation, and that what would at ﬁrst glance appear as

seemingly contradictory elements of Pianella’s public and private identity, were

not viewed as such by the nation or its head.πΩ Indeed, despite Venice’s attempts to

conceal the fact that non-Venetians traded under its auspices, the Ottomans may

have been aware of this fact. In a command of 1530, the sultan ordered the kadı of

Gallipoli to protect Venetian merchants and ‘‘other wayfarers who are under the

name of the Venetians.’’∫≠

While on one level accepted as an inﬂuential, contributing member of the

nation, a merchant in Pianella’s situation represented a distinct risk as well, as

evidenced by Lippomano’s report of an incident involving the Ottoman. Accom-

panying a caravan of more than thirty horses carrying jewels and other goods,

Pianella was detained by a local o≈cial in the Ottoman lands neighboring Ragusa,

who was intent on taking his merchandise and perhaps his life. Through the

bailo’s intervention, Pianella was freed unharmed. But, as the bailo warned, ‘‘If it

had been discovered that he is a haracgüzar, everything would have been ﬁnished

and lost.’’∫∞ The dangers of this type of situation were clear: as an Ottoman

subject, Pianella was not legally subject to the jurisdiction of the bailo, even

though he traded as a Venetian and represented other Venetian merchants. Were

he to die or encounter legal or commercial problems, according to Ottoman

practice his goods, even if they belonged to Venetian patricians, were subject to

conﬁscation. While clear laws, applying to both Muslim and non-Muslim, gov-

erned questions of inheritance, and conﬁscation rarely occurred arbitrarily, the

danger did exist. This could make even more problematic the already sticky situa-

tion of disposing of the estate of a Venetian merchant deceased in Ottoman lands.

Despite these very real dangers presented by Ottomans trading as Venetians,

Pianella was by no means unique. A similar case involved Niccolò Soruro, who

traded as part of the nation in Constantinople from April 1601 to his death in

March 1624.∫≤ Soruro was an active merchant: in 1603 he and several partners

acquired a ship, the Santa Caterina, in Constantinople. In later years, he partnered

with the Venetian merchant Gianmaria Parente, and they maintained a thriving

trade with the French ambassador and many Ottoman-Muslim o≈cials, including

the chief Defterdar, who invested some 100,000 akçe with them.∫≥ Soruro traded

"
71,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

57

most ly in large quantities of cloth: in 1613 he received two shipments via caravan

in the span of three months, valued at 667,600 and 563,000 akçe respectively.∫∂

Soruro also established close ties with Venetian o≈cials; he traded for Simone

Tosi, ragionato under Simone Contarini, and stood as godfather (by proxy) at the

baptism of Tosi’s child.∫∑

Soruro is an example of the protean character of identity in the Mediterranean

world. He was born in Famagosta, Cyprus, and although his parents were Vene-

tian subjects, they came under Ottoman rule with the fall of the island in 1572. We

do not know his birth date, so there is a chance Niccolò was born a Venetian

subject, but certainly by a young age he was an Ottoman subject. The status of

former Venetian subjects from Cyprus after the Ottoman conquest is somewhat

byzantine: following the loss of the island, many Cypriots who had escaped were

permitted to sett le in Venice, and some were granted early citizenship before they

had met their residency requirements. Indeed, two of the most important brokers

in Venice in this period, Michel Siro and Cesare Nixia, were both Cypriots who

were enslaved at the fall of the island and escaped to good fortune in Venice.∫∏

While Cypriots received some preferential treatment, Venice openly acknowl-

edged that the Nation cipriotta was ‘‘subject to the Signor Turk.’’∫π In Soruro’s

case, while he was publicly labeled and treated as a Venetian merchant, the docu-

ments make explicit that he was a haracgüzar of the sultan. Giorgio Giustinian

acknowledged this when he wrote ‘‘though he was Cypriot he traded as a Vene-

tian.’’∫∫ Like Pianella, Soruro functioned entirely as if he were a Venetian citizen

merchant, though he was in reality a subject of the sultan.

There was some danger to Venice in granting citizenship to Cypriots who

sought it; the Ottomans clearly considered them their own subjects and thus as

liable to Ottoman taxes, laws, and courts, regardless of Venice’s policies.∫Ω In

Soruro’s case, his subject status led the Ottoman woman he had married to claim

his estate for the son she had born him months before his death. She took her

case to Ottoman o≈cials, including the Müfti, and Soruro’s business partner was

even imprisoned for a time. Eventually the bailo was able to free the man and

recover Soruro’s goods, but not without substantial trouble and expense.Ω≠

Ottomans were not the only nonsubjects who traded as Venetians. In 1596

Marco Venier reported the failure and ﬂight of a merchant in Galata, ‘‘a Ludovico,

who had himself called dei Ludovici . . . who had in his hands the business of

several of our men from Venice, and though he was held to be an Anconitan, he

passed as a Venetian and was treated as a Venetian, as I saw happen when I came

to the Bailate, and as has continued since.’’Ω∞ During this time Ludovici was

prominent ly involved in the nation in Constantinople: he represented some of

"
72,"58

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

the most important Venetian Levantine merchants, patrician and citizen, and

purchased a ship in Constantinople in association with several other merchants;

this may have precipitated his collapse. In addition, Ludovici was extensively

invested with Ottoman merchants— Jews and Muslims— and also a number of

Ottoman o≈cials.Ω≤ What ultimately ruined him was excessive debt; as Marco

Venier said, ‘‘his having wanted to spend much and at the same time to borrow

much.’’ Venier estimated his indebtedness at thirty thousand scudi and blamed

Ludovici’s failure on his Jewish creditors, though this was an exaggeration, as

other sources show that Ludovici had debts ‘‘from many parts,’’ including mem-

bers of the Venetian community.Ω≥

Ludovici’s case created numerous problems for the nation, and in response

the Council of Twelve elected two merchants to oversee the case. In addition,

because so many Ottomans were a√ected, the kadı of Galata elected a Jewish and

Christian subject of the sultan, ‘‘according to the Turkish practice,’’ to do the

same, whom he submitted for the approval of the council, which was given.Ω∂ This

initial cooperation broke down over the division of Ludovici’s remaining assets,

and the matter escalated to the grand vizier, who ordered all Venetian ships held

in port until Ludovici’s inﬂuential Ottoman creditors were reimbursed.Ω∑ Bailo

Venier tried mightily to have the matter returned to his jurisdiction, but Ludo-

vici’s Ottoman creditors argued that as Ludovici was not a Venetian, he was

subject to the French ambassador, under whose protection all persons from states

not o≈cially recognized by the sultan had to trade. Venier’s counter is revealing;

he argued that Ludovici ‘‘did not deal with French, but with Venetians . . . since he

was a Venetian factor who traded the capital of those in Venice, who had con-

stituted him their factor here, he was under the jurisdiction of the Venetian

Bailate, he entered into our Councils of Twelve, and in all things was treated as a

Venetian, and if it had been otherwise, the Ambassador of France would not have

allowed me to insert myself in the persons and matters of his subjects.’’Ω∏

The Venetian representative acknowledged that Ludovici was not legally recog-

nized as Venetian, but since he had identiﬁed himself as part of the nation, had

associated and traded with other Venetian merchants, juridical recognition was

unnecessary. Because Ludovici had been accepted and traded with the Venetian

nation, he was, de facto, a part of it and thus subject to its head, the bailo. For

Venier, and indeed for Venice generally, merchants’ identities were ﬂexible; one

could become a merchant of Venice simply by acting as if one were Venetian.

Legal recognition, while desirable, was not essential.Ωπ

The cases of the Ottomans Pianella and Soruro and the Anconitan Ludovici

clearly demonstrate both the presence of and the trials associated with non-

"
73,"t h e m e r c h a n t s o f v e n i c e

59

Venetians trading in the nation. Although their trade was coveted and their ser-

vice needed, their presence opened a Pandora’s box of potential problems. As

Venier observed, failures such as Ludovici’s led Ottoman creditors to attempt to

bring political pressure to bear on deliberations regarding the resolution of the

bankruptcy and the division of assets. This situation, already fraught with di≈-

culty, would become impossible ‘‘if some chief Turk and Hebrew merchants,

great ly favored by the principals of the Porte, . . . heard that a Foreigner under the

name of a Venetian merchant and factor had sent elsewhere ships and merchan-

dise without them having received any payment from them . . . This would cause a

disturbance to public a√airs [i.e., diplomatic relations].’’Ω∫ The disturbances in-

cluded Ottoman expectations that all damages involving Venetians be covered by

public funds, and that Ottoman claims be satisﬁed before Venetian ones, which

meant that someone like Piero Bragadin’s father, Zuane, who had lost much

capital as a result of Ludovici’s failure, probably would never recover his money.

Given the di≈culties faced with some regularity in recognizing Ottoman and

other non-subjects as de facto members of the nation, one might wonder why

Venetian authorities would ever accept, let alone facilitate, this practice. Clearly,

the most compelling reason for doing so can be found in the commercial chal-

lenges Venice faced in the post-Lepanto era. The expanding role of French, then

English and Dutch, traders, as well as the ongoing competition of Ottoman and

Jewish merchants all coalesced to make the Levantine trade an extremely com-

petitive and dynamic commercial milieu, and one in which Venice no longer was

in a dominant position. This increased competition, combined with the ﬂight of

the patriciate and the general disinterest of the cittadini originari in commercial

matters, forced Venetians to innovate. One such innovation was the creation of

the V Savii, or board of trade, early in the sixteenth century; another was the

reductions of customs duties on eastern goods. A ﬁnal transformation was in the

city’s commercial personnel; Venice increasingly came to rely on new groups and

individuals to keep the still signiﬁcant Levantine tra≈c alive. Preferably these

merchants would be naturalized citizens, but in order to encourage eastern trade,

authorities were willing to turn a blind eye to the participation of subjects and

foreigners who had not met the requirements for citizenship. Driven by the same

imperative, the Signoria embraced, somewhat hesitant ly to be sure, the participa-

tion of Jewish merchants in this trade and granted them unique privileges not

available even to most Christian subjects.ΩΩ For the same reasons, Venice increas-

ingly encouraged and facilitated Ottoman-Muslim merchants trading in Venice

with favorable customs rates and the construction of the fondaco dei turchi.∞≠≠ The

same motivation, then, explains why the baili and other Venetian o≈cials were

"
74,"60

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

willing to permit men like Soruro, Ludovici, Pianella, and many others, to trade

under the aegis of the nation in Constantinople and why they continued to accept

the challenges that often arose as a result of this practice.∞≠∞

Whatever the motivation, it seems clear that the monochromatic image of the

typical Venetian merchant, and of the complexion of the Venetian trading nation,

for the early modern period at least, must be dramatically revised. In the Venetian

trading nation in Constantinople, by the middle of the sixteenth century noble

merchants were e√ectively absent. Venetians made easily outnumbered Vene-

tians born and were supplemented by a sizable cross-section of merchants drawn

from throughout the Mediterranean littoral. In this ﬂuid world, categories of iden-

tity such as Venetian, Ottoman, Greek— perhaps even Muslim, Jew, and Christian

—were not set in stone; rather they were adaptable and situational. The merchants

of Venice, in many ways then, represent the multiplicity and multilayered charac-

ter of identities possible in the frontier world of the Mediterranean.

The Uno≈cial Nation

Banditi, Schiavi, Greci

The Venetian nation in Constantinople in the early modern era was, in narrow

legal terms, limited to the bailo, his famiglia, and the merchants possessing legal

status as full Venetian citizens. These groups arrayed themselves around the

institutions and physical space of the bailate, and represented the o≈cial nation,

sanctioned and recognized by the sponsoring state, the Republic of Venice. Sur-

rounding this small core of the o≈cial nation, however, there existed a much

broader community comprising men and women who identiﬁed themselves, and

were identiﬁed to varying degrees, with Venice, its rulers, and its institutions.

In strict ly institutional and juridical terms, these individuals were not mem-

bers of the o≈cial nation. Their presence was without o≈cial sanction; they had

no legal or constituent status or right to participate in the o≈cial community; and

they maintained only minimal claim on the services and protection of the nation.

But if we break free of this structuralist view with its rigid boundaries and instead

consider community in a broader sense, as a number of important recent studies

have, then these marginal individuals and groups constitute an integral part of

the larger whole.∞ Despite their murky legal status, these peripheral members of

the Venetian community were acknowledged by the institutions of the nation,

participated in their activities and life, and beneﬁted from these associations.

These individuals existed on the fringes of the nation yet were in many ways a

central part of it, and their existence forces us to reconsider both nation and

community in the context of the early modern Mediterranean.

At any given time in the period after Lepanto, Venice’s diplomats, their fami-

glie, and the sanctioned merchants numbered probably no more than a hundred

"
76,"62

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

individuals total. They were signiﬁcant ly outnumbered by the several thousand

men and women who moved in and out of the orbit of the o≈cial nation and who

resided in Constantinople without o≈cial approval. Some came from Venice

proper or the terraferma ; the majority, however, were Greek-Venetian subjects.

Their motivations for coming to the Ottoman capital varied: some were slaves,

others banditi—men and women banished from Venetian territories for criminal

activities, unpaid debts, or other infractions. Some were small-scale traders who

came to sell lemons, oils, or wines independent of the o≈cial nation; others

sought work as artisans in Ottoman industries, especially shipbuilding and tex-

tiles. Some were travelers drawn by the allure of the Mediterranean’s largest city.≤

The status of this uno≈cial contingent was ambiguous. Some individuals,

while not o≈cially incorporated into the nation, nonetheless worked closely with

its members and provided useful services, carrying out many of its more onerous

tasks, such as bagging and transporting cloth, loading ships, and baking bread. In

addition, they often functioned as an uno≈cial intelligence network for the baili.

At the same time, Constantinople was the front line in the always sensitive rela-

tions between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, and the maintenance of this

balance was often precarious. Thus the presence of unauthorized persons in the

Ottoman capital posed a potential political risk to the republic. Often such individ-

uals possessed knowledge of artisanal techniques in shipbuilding, glassmaking,

and other industrial activities which the Signoria did not want passed on to

Venice’s powerful neighbor. Many soldiers and sailors with detailed knowledge of

the extensive defenses of Venice’s stato da mar also ended up in the city. And the

fear of spontaneous conversion to Islam always loomed large as well. Thus,

Venice’s rulers attempted to control the presence and activities of all its citizens

and subjects in Constantinople, wavering between tolerating these groups and

encouraging them to return home with promises of pardons and employment.

This chapter examines the various parts of this diverse but uno≈cial com-

munity, their reasons for being in Constantinople, and some of the problems

they encountered and created while in the city. The focus is primarily on three

groups— banished people, slaves, and Greek subjects. To understand their roles

provides a more nuanced understanding of the constituent elements of the Vene-

tian nation in Constantinople, and the need to problematize and progress beyond

strict ly juridical and political deﬁnitions of community and early modern trading

nations.

i banditi

While popular views of Venetian justice often conjure images of secret hang-

ings and poisonings carried out by the malevolent Council of Ten, the reality is

that many individuals were condemned but few were actually executed. Much

more common were monetary ﬁnes or banishment.≥ During the ‘‘hot years’’ of

crime in the late sixteenth century, increasing population combined with agricul-

tural shortfalls, rising prices, and expensive military and political ventures by the

Venetian Signoria created an environment in which levels of criminality, and thus

of banishment, increased precipitously. At any given time a signiﬁcant group of

banditi— banished men, women, and even families— existed on the periphery of

the Venetian state. Many of these remained as close as legally permissible to their

own homes and often contributed to an increasing lawlessness and banditry on

the borderlands of early modern states.∂

While exile in the Venetian terraferma has been extensively studied, the stato da

mar has attracted less attention. The records of the baili, however, provide a

window onto crime and banishment in the most distant corners of the empire

and suggest the place within the broader Venetian community of the many ban-

ished men and women who worked their way to Constantinople. Banditi were

drawn to the Ottoman capital for two chief reasons: ﬁrst were the economic and

social possibilities the city presented; second, many more banditi came seeking an

audience with the baili, who were legally empowered with broad authority to

review and rescind sentences issued by courts from throughout the Venetian

Empire. At their discretion, the baili could grant ‘‘liberation, safe-conduct, permu-

tation, moderation of sentence, or other criminal pardon,’’ which permitted ban-

diti to return to their homes, or at least to Venetian lands under the protection of a

salvacondotto, or safe-conduct, recognized throughout the empire.∑ These safe-

conducts were highly sought after because they permitted the banished person to

return to clearly speciﬁed areas within the Venetian state, often for a limited

period of time. With this permission of passage, exiles were able to visit family

and friends they may have not seen for years and to attempt to clear their names,

often by paying o√ debts, which were the most common cause of banishment.

It is not entirely clear when the baili obtained these broad powers, which very

few Venetian o≈cials enjoyed.∏ Certainly they resulted from a recognition of the

unique nature and location of their mission. The chief councils of Venice awarded

this right, and encouraged its liberal application, because of political more than

legal expediencies. The banditi had potential to cause greater disturbances to the

"
78,"64

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

sensitive diplomatic dealings in Constantinople than to the public order in Vene-

tian lands. The challenge, however, was to grant salvacondotti in such a way as to

avoid giving the impression that the law could be broken with impunity. This

balance proved elusive and led to regular questioning of the baili and their use of

their ample powers, particularly as the Council of Ten became the dominant

political and judicial institution in the Venetian state over the course of the six-

teenth century.π

In 1586, for example, the Council of Ten decided that the baili could remand

sentences imposed by most magistracies inside the city and throughout its em-

pire, except for those issued by either the Council of Ten itself or the judicial body,

the Quarantia, which could not be altered without these bodies’ permission. But

confusion and overuse by the baili continued, and the council issued numerous

rea≈rmations and clariﬁcations of its rulings in an attempt to reign in the abusive

use of salvacondotti throughout the Venetian state.∫ Indeed, despite the evolving

laws, many banditi still trekked to Constantinople hoping for a sympathetic hear-

ing of their cases.Ω The baili had the power to commute a wide range of o√enses,

so as to maintain order within the Venetian community in the sensitive environ-

ment of Venice’s powerful Ottoman neighbor. Yet, paradoxically, by trying to

remove banditi and other uno≈cial elements from the city, they probably attracted

many others who came in hopes of having their sentences modiﬁed.

While there are no statistics on the banditi in early modern Constantinople,

ﬁgures do exist for the Venetian state as a whole, which indicate how common-

place banishment was. For the period 1600– 1607, for example, one scholar has

counted 17,294 sentences of banishment issued throughout the Venetian state.

The actual total is certainly much higher, as this ﬁgure does not include sentences

issued in Corfu and Candia, areas where banishment was widely used. Another

source reports that in 1601, six hundred banished men and women lived in Zante,

a striking ﬁgure given that the island’s total population was less than twenty

thousand.∞≠

The number of exiles resident in Constantinople almost certainly exceeded

that in Zante. Very often, a sentence of banishment required the guilty party to

stay out of all Venetian territories, as in the case of Alvise Morosini, who killed two

men in a rival’s gondola and was banished ‘‘in perpetuity from the city and the

Dogate, and from all the other cities, lands, and places of the landed and maritime

Dominion, and ships both armed and disarmed.’’ A law of 1443 prohibited banditi

from coming within ﬁfteen miles of any Venetian territory.∞∞ In situations of total

exile, the only option was to ﬁnd refuge in some non-Venetian territory, and for

Venetians, and especially subjects of the stato da mar, the immediateness of the

"
79,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

65

Ottoman Empire made it an attractive option for two reasons. First, for eco-

nomically uprooted exiles the Ottoman capital represented a much more promis-

ing destination than a small island like Zante or some minor regional town;

second, the presence in Constantinople of a high Venetian o≈cial with authority

to review sentences issued by almost all Venetian magistracies made the city even

more inviting.

The many salvacondotti recorded in the voluminous chancellery protocols give

some sense of the banditi’s numbers in Constantinople. Without exception, safe-

conducts are the most common actions registered in the protocols after Lepanto.

For example, the rubrics of Giovanni Cappello from February 1630 to February

1633 contain 188 salvacondotti granted to supplicants guilty of o√enses ranging

from unpaid debts to murder. Several years later, Bailo Alvise Contarini issued

more than double this number, 399 from early 1636 to October of 1640.∞≤ These

numbers are particularly striking when viewed in the context of the small size of

the Venetian community in the Ottoman capital.

The majority of the banditi who appeared in Constantinople were Greek-

Venetian subjects; many others came from the Venetian terraferma and Dalma-

tian coast. There were also occasional cases of Jewish exiles whose causes were

often taken up by important Porte ﬁgures.∞≥ While most banditi came from the

lower classes, there were instances of noble banishment, such as Giulio Marini,

described as ‘‘one of the falsest men born in this world,’’ and Zuanne Boldù,

banished for unpaid debts by the Council of Ten in 1591 and only granted permis-

sion to reenter Venice’s stato da mar in 1611. In general, however, noble banditi

from Venice proper were the exception. More common were local nobles ban-

ished from the island possessions of the stato da mar.∞∂

The crimes that led to banishment varied: some were for moral o√enses, such

as the man excommunicated and banished after being caught in ﬂagrante during a

nocturnal visit to a cloistered nun, or Margarita of Tínos, banished in 1615 for

‘‘carnal commerce,’’ or the Jew Afrizele banished for gambling.∞∑ Much more

common were banishments resulting from poverty or inability to pay debts, as in

the case of Boldù, who was expelled because of ‘‘his poor and lamentable state’’

due to a debt he owed another patrician.∞∏ While most banishments seem to have

been for lesser misdeeds, there were cases of serious crimes as well, such as the

man from Canea banished for fratricide, or Antonio Senessene and his wife, both

banished from Candia for murder.∞π

It was not unusual for exiles who appeared in Constantinople to have spent

ﬁve, ten, even twenty years in exile. Boldù lived under a sentence of banishment

for twenty years, and a man from Rettimo described spending twenty-one years of

"
80,"66

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

his life ‘‘wandering.’’∞∫ Neither of these men probably passed his entire exile in

Constantinople, but evidence suggests that in many cases banditi came to Con-

stantinople for its economic opportunities and often stayed on for years and even

decades working in Ottoman industries and on Ottoman galleys. However long

they spent in Constantinople, it is clear that at any given time the city was inhab-

ited by a signiﬁcant contingent of banditi from Venetian territories.

A parte issued by the Senate in 1620 indicates the several alternatives the baili

possessed for dealing with the unending parade of banditi who appeared in their

chambers. One option was to commute a sentence entirely, e√ectively allowing

the exile to repatriate. Alternatively, the bailo could grant a safe-conduct and

permission to travel and sett le in certain restricted areas within the Venetian state,

though in ‘‘atrocious cases’’ the exile was generally not allowed to return to the

scene of the original o√ense.∞Ω A third possibility was to free the supplicant

conditionally, dependent on a certain period of service, usually on the war galleys,

in return for a recision of the banishment.≤≠ Finally, of course, the baili could

refuse to grant any alteration to the sentence.≤∞

Despite the many banditi who passed through Constantinople, and the serious-

ness of some crimes, this latter option was rarely utilized. The potential danger to

the a√airs of state and to the soul of the supplicant made it generally in the best

interests of both parties to move the exiles out of the city expeditiously and quiet ly.

Exiles seem to have understood that due to the sensitivity of the situation in

Constantinople salvacondotti could be obtained more easily there, which attracted

many men and women to the city. Even when he could not legally modify a

sentence, a letter of support from a bailo could often sway the Council of Ten or

Quarantia; thus many people banished by these magistracies came to Constan-

tinople to present their case in hopes of obtaining a favorable recommendation.≤≤

The relative ease of obtaining alterations to sentences in Constantinople re-

sulted from Venice’s desire to control its subjects and citizens in the city. The

Ottoman capital was considered a physically and morally dangerous space, and

the presence of any unauthorized persons, particularly criminals, represented a

signiﬁcant risk both to themselves and to the state. As one bailo wrote, ‘‘the liberty

of Turkish living, the lasciviousness of the Turkish women and the corrupt cus-

toms of the renegades would have the power to make a saint a devil.’’≤≥ Individuals

or groups who might potentially upset the sensitive Veneto-Ottoman relation-

ship, or might agitate or impede the diplomatic and commercial missions of the

nation, were classed persone non grate. Marco Venier’s statement suggests the

baili’s challenge: ‘‘It pains me extremely that many men banished . . . end up

coming here with much greater danger and with much greater travail for me.’’≤∂

"
81,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

67

To avoid this peril, Venetian policy was ﬁrst to try and prevent banditi from

coming to Constantinople at all, and failing this, to encourage them to leave

quickly by issuing safe-passages, commutations of sentences, and even ﬁnancial

incentives.≤∑ The motivations behind the policy are made clear in the experience

of Giandomenico Moro from Venice, who ‘‘had lived here [Constantinople] evilly

for some time.’’ Despite this, Simone Contarini granted him a safe-conduct,

contingent on his serving three years at half pay as a uomo da spada on a Venetian

galley. Contarini did this because Moro ‘‘has truthfully given me very great travail

because of his bad behavior, . . . I came to the resolution to remove this Gian-

domenico from here as a person of great scandal, so that in serving on a galley . . .

he may not have occasion to commit a greater evil here to the public detriment,

and in particular to his soul. Your Excellency is very prudent and knows very well

how much better it is to eschew a lesser evil, so as not to incur a greater one.’’≤∏

As the case of Giandomenico Moro suggests, banditi and other unauthorized

persons presented a number of dangers to Venice and its subjects by their pres-

ence in the sultan’s capital. These were at least threefold— political, commercial,

and spiritual— and all were closely 

interconnected. Although Venice 

ideally

wanted no subjects or citizens in Ottoman territory without o≈cial sanction,

there were certain categories of people earmarked for a quick return to Venetian

lands. Primary among them were men who possessed specialized knowledge or

technical skills that could be of use to the Ottomans either militarily or commer-

cially. As Marco Venier indicated, the objective was ‘‘to prevent the Turks taking

advantage of our people in the production of the most important things to use

against us . . . because by our own men in this Arsenal have been made, and has

been taught the making of among other things, large galleys no di√erent than our

own.’’≤π Not surprisingly, then, many of the salvacondotti issued in Constanti-

nople, particularly to men from Venice and the terraferma, went to artisans with

specialized and sensitive skills.

The most common examples involved workers from the famed arsenals in

Venice and Candia— carpenters, caulkers, and other master craftsmen.≤∫ One

bailo reported, with some exaggeration, that there were so many banditi in Con-

stantinople that ‘‘they make up a great part of the workers in the Turks’ arsenal.’’

A report of 1591 placed the number of skilled banditi in Ottoman arsenals at

three hundred, a signiﬁcant portion, if accurate, of the 838 permanent craftsmen

who worked in the Galata arsenal in 1604.≤Ω

The fear among Venetian o≈cials was that once banished, these men would

come to work in the sultan’s arsenals and reveal closely-guarded trade secrets,

out of either desperation or revenge. Experience proved such fears to be well-

"
82,"68

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

founded. One carpenter banished from Venice for a ‘‘minimal a√air’’ was dis-

covered working in the arsenal in Galata and given a safe-conduct to encourage

him to leave. Another, a master carpenter convicted of murder, came to Con-

stantinople and was o√ered by no less a ﬁgure than the kapudanpa¸sa a position in

the arsenal that would allow him to live ‘‘very comfortably.’’ Despite the serious-

ness of his crime, the bailo immediately began working to remove the man from

temptation’s way. It was important to catch potential problems before they mush-

roomed: a carpenter from Candia and ﬁve other men banished from Venice were

‘‘continually solicited to enter and work in this Arsenal,’’ and so the bailo had

them retained ‘‘because once [they] would have begun [work], dragging them

away would have been perhaps more di≈cult.’’≥≠

Another targeted industry was cloth manufacturing. One cloth-worker, ban-

ished from Venice by the Signori di notte, received ‘‘very vigorous incitements to

exercise his art from several of these Turkish merchants, who gave him great

hopes of earnings and proﬁt because of the desire they have of introducing the

silk industry into Constantinople.’’ The bailo wanted to get the man out of Con-

stantinople as quickly as possible, particularly because the Ottomans were at the

same time trying to start up a wool industry through the e√orts of a number of

Marranos.≥∞ In another case, a silk-worker was given a safe-conduct, though his

papers’ reference to a number of Venetians who were still ‘‘making . . . canvasses

and other cloths,’’ conﬁrms that there were many expert craftsmen willing to shop

their services whom the baili could not deﬂect from the city.≥≤

Sailors and other men with maritime experience also found ready oppor-

tunities in Constantinople. In the years before Lepanto, Bailo Antonio Tiepolo

estimated there were enough banditi from Candia alone to man at least thirty of

the sultan’s galleys; a decade later Giovanni Moro put the number at twenty

galleys. These Greek-Venetian sailors and ship workers were commonly known

as marioli, ‘‘Candiots,’’ as Tiepolo described them, ‘‘who, banished from Candia,

entertained themselves in the taverns of Pera.’’ By 1600, their numbers seem to

have been reduced somewhat due in part to Venetian policies to discourage immi-

gration by creating opportunities on the Greek islands, though this ﬂow was

never entirely stanched.≥≥

Besides these strategic and industrial dangers, there was also a spiritual dan-

ger in allowing banditi to remain in Constantinople. Considerable concern existed

that men would renounce their faith and become Muslim, or even Protestant, as

in the case of a friar from Chios who scaled the wall of his convent, went to the

English embassy, and entered ‘‘the errors of Luther.’’≥∂ If Constantinople was

dangerous for men, it was even more perilous for women and children, who were

"

69

believed to be spiritually weaker and morally more susceptible. While the baili

complained that conversions made it more di≈cult to spirit subjects out of Con-

stantinople, they also seem genuinely to have felt a paternalistic burden of provid-

ing spiritual protection to their charges. One example, not at all isolated, involved

a thirteen-year-old boy from Rettimo who appeared in Constantinople, having

ﬂed for fear of being accused of a murder he did not commit. Of this case, Almoro

Nani wrote, ‘‘I decided not to allow him to wander in any part of the city because

of the danger that children of a tender age run here, so I kept him in my palace . . .

having decided it good to remove him from here.’’≥∑

While motivations were often sincere, the issuance of safe-conducts and com-

mutations was a complicated question, and a source of debate among Venice’s

stato da mar o≈cials. While all agreed that excessive banishments and commuta-

tions produced signiﬁcant problems, the solution did not generate any such

unanimity. At work were conﬂicting exigencies of public order. The baili and the

Signoria wanted to limit the presence of Venetians and subjects in Constanti-

nople to a small, controllable, o≈cial contingent. To do this it was necessary to

facilitate the departure of undesirables who possessed specialized knowledge or

might create disturbances among, or bring unwanted attention to, the Venetian

community. In contrast, the rectors and other o≈cials in the Venetian terraferma

and stato da mar wanted to be able to use banishment liberally in order to rid their

lands of disruptive criminal elements.

Alvise Giustinian, proveditor generale in Candia in 1591 described the tension

between these two objectives. He recounted an incident when several criminals

implicated in murders, burglaries and other illegal acts ﬂed Candia before ap-

pearing in court. He was certain ‘‘that they were about to have recourse to the

Illustrious Bailo in Constantinople to obtain a safe-conduct . . . I know that

ejecting these types from the Kingdom is ragione di stato because of the consola-

tion and respite that the people feel from it, and so returning them would have a

contrary e√ect.’’ Granting such criminals salvacondotti, he believed, ‘‘produces

bad fruits, because it serves as an invitation to all Candiots to commit crimes

and to free themselves from their caprices, as they can be certain, because of

the experience they see every day, to receive absolution quickly through a safe-

conduct. With this opportunity to travel to Constantinople, . . . that which Your

Lordships had hoped to avoid occurs, because it is certain that many for mediocre

sins without the hope of a safe-conduct would accept their banishment, or would

attempt other means, which are not lacking in that Kingdom, to absolve them-

selves. They would not go to Constantinople, where they are easily able to interact

with and befriend Turks, and where many of them remain.’’≥∏

"
84,"70

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Another o≈cial in Candia, Tommaso Priuli, further observed that many ban-

diti returned from Constantinople with safe-conducts that required them to serve

on the galleys in the event of a mobilization, ‘‘and in the meantime they go freely

wherever they please.’’ During Priuli’s tour of duty, a man who was indebted to

the state was banished and told that ‘‘if he did not pay the debt that he had to the

Prince he could not be absolved.’’ He went direct ly to Constantinople and ob-

tained a safe-conduct with a few minor stipulations; this was not in Venice’s best

interests in the long run, as ‘‘many debtors by hiding all that they have, obtain

everything.’’≥π

Bailo Simone Contarini, in defending his handling of the banditi, presented

the other side of the equation. He reported, ‘‘I regulated myself in the wisest

manner that I believed conformed to the commissions of Your Lordship,’’ even

though the rectors at times did not think so. In his time, he ‘‘with great a∆iction

of soul, saw two or three times’’ that when men banished from Candia came for

commutations, and he was not forthcoming with them, they ‘‘turned Turks before

my very eyes’’ and joined with the kapudanpa¸sa. For Contarini, the great danger of

this was that through these men the Ottomans not only obtained their services as

carpenters, pilots, and sailors, but also important information about the situa-

tion in the few remaining, vulnerable Greek islands in the stato da mar.≥∫ Gian-

francesco Morosini complained of the same problem, that desperate banditi often

‘‘became Turks’’ to remedy their situation; he suggested ‘‘it would be good to

command in Candia and in the other islands . . . that they abstain as much as

possible [from banishment] because the people of this sort who end up here are

the cause of many inconvenienti.’’≥Ω

In spite of these inconveniences and the repeated calls for reform, the Sig-

noria did not temper the use of banishment or the baili’s authority to grant safe-

conducts. Exile was a key means of punishment in the Venetian legal system, and

the Senate and other legislative bodies were unable to conceive of a workable

alternative. There were suggestions: one o≈cial proposed that Venetian o≈cials

in Candia be allowed to issue safe-conducts to those banished from their island

because ‘‘reason dictates that it would also be good if the proveditor generale could

give [salvacondotti ] in that Kingdom so that [the banditi ] would not have need

to go [to Constantinople].’’ Another o≈cial suggested creating a sanctuary, a

sort of internal prison colony, so that banditi would not be compelled to go to

Constantinople to receive commutations. These ideas were never implemented,

perhaps because to do so would have reduced the already relatively ine√ectual

penalty of banishment.∂≠

Despite the best e√orts of the baili to remove the banditi from Constantinople,

"
85,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

71

then, there was always a signiﬁcant number present in the city, and while many

came only temporarily to seek a safe-conduct, a certain number remained and

even sett led in the city. Although their legal situations compromised their status

as subjects, most banditi still considered themselves, and were received as, a part

of the larger Venetian community. Many participated in the life of the nation and

submitted themselves to the jurisdictional authority of the baili, and in general

the o≈cial core of the nation, the diplomats and merchants considered the banditi

as legitimate parts of the broader Venetian community.

Gregorio di Giana, for example, was banished for murder in 1586, came to

Constantinople, and became a useful member of the nation. Because he had

worked in the Venetian arsenal, the bailo sent him to Anatolia to observe the

construction of some Ottoman ships there. Such a mission was not uncommon,

as the baili regularly used banditi for espionage activities; indeed, one scholar has

argued that banished men working in the Ottoman arsenal were ‘‘subsidized as

agents of the Signoria.’’ Another banished subject, who still ‘‘conserve[d] devotion

towards’’ Venice, reported on happenings in the household of the kapudanpa¸sa.∂∞

An exile from Treviso lived in the embassy for three years because the bailo found

him to be a man of ‘‘lively intellect who works in stucco and painting.’’ So accom-

plished was the man that the Persian ambassador in Constantinople invited him

to Baghdad to work for the shah, who was a great lover of art. The bailo granted

him a safe-conduct in return for a promise to inform on a√airs in the court there.∂≤

Men accused of serious crimes in Venice were not ostracized from the nation.

Bernardo Argiti was banished by the Quarantia for homicide and eventually

arrived in Constantinople. He worked closely with the nation’s o≈cial merchants,

several of whom speciﬁcally requested that Argiti be given a safe-conduct to ac-

company several other exiles to the Greek peninsula to purchase grain. This was

no small responsibility, either, as these men were entrusted with large amounts of

cash and sent to oversee Ottoman ship captains retained to carry the grain to

Venice and its dominions during the di≈cult famine year of 1591.∂≥ Another

banished man, Domenico Balsarino, went on a similar mission, with eight thou-

sand ducats ‘‘from public funds’’; he was chosen in part because he had been in

Ottoman lands long enough to become acquainted with its ‘‘language and cus-

toms.’’ He used this experience to his beneﬁt and in 1610 was elected Venetian

consul in Chios. Eventually his son became consul, and in 1637, his grandson

Carlo was accepted as a giovane della lingua.∂∂ Finally, there is the case of Marcan-

tonio Zuccarini, a cittadino originario, who in 1591 with several other men chased

the son of a butcher into a church in Venice and killed him. Zuccarini was

banished, but the Quarantia conceded him a safe-conduct that permitted him to

"
86,"72

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

travel to Constantinople, where his brother was the rasonato to Matteo Zane.

Despite his crime, he too was used ‘‘in several expeditions . . . in the public

service’’ and in 1593 was granted a safe-conduct to return to Venice.∂∑

As these cases indicate, banditi were regularly included in the normal life of

the larger Venetian community. While not o≈cially sanctioned, they were known

and trusted by the diplomatic and mercantile core of the nation; they o√ered

services, provided espionage, and even lived in the bailate. Such service often

translated into important evidence in support of their requests to repatriate. In

other cases, they parlayed their experience into highly desirable positions and

important responsibilities. They represent a constant ly changing, sizable, and

important segment of the uno≈cial nation.

s l a v e s

Joining the many banditi on the margins of the uno≈cial Venetian community

in Constantinople was another large group of individuals with ties to Venice,

slaves. While more peripheral and often restricted in their engagement, they

nonetheless were seen as constituents of the broadly deﬁned Venetian nation,

and their care and protection was considered a signiﬁcant responsibility for all

baili and other members of the community.

Because slavery was legally and morally acceptable in Islam (one bailo felt

slaves were esteemed ‘‘on par with women and horses’’), there were many slaves

throughout the Ottoman Empire. The most recent study on Mediterranean slavery

estimates that between 1 and 1.5 million European Christians were enslaved on the
Barbary Coast alone between 1530 and 1780.∂∏ For Constantinople, ˙Inalcık esti-

mates that the total number of slaves, prisoners-of-war, and boys of the dev¸sirme

numbered sixty thousand in 1568, and one hundred thousand in 1609, or approxi-

mately one-ﬁfth of the city’s population. An apostolic visitor in 1581 estimated that

there were eight to nine thousand slaves in Galata alone, though this probably
refers only to Christian galley slaves, whose numbers ˙Inalcık puts at ten thou-

sand.∂π While many in the city owned slaves, Morosini’s claim that every house-

hold had at least one Russian slave was probably an exaggeration. Rather, the great

majority of the slaves belonged to the sultan, with the bulk of the rest in the

hands of important Ottoman o≈cials. Under Süleyman I, for example, the o≈cial

Iskender Çelebi owned six to seven thousand slaves, many more than the grand

vizier’s approximately 1,700. Even midlevel o≈cials had slaves: a 1557 inventory of

one such man’s possessions included 156 slaves; most were from the Caucasus,

Bosnia, and Hungary and just ten from Western Europe.∂∫

"
87,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

73

The number of slaves in the Ottoman capital was not static. Periods of open

warfare produced large numbers of slaves: the decade following Lepanto, for

instance, was marked by intense e√orts to exchange prisoners,∂Ω including Cer-

vantes, who lived ﬁve years in the bagno of Algiers.∑≠ Over the long run, though,

the most consistent source of slaves was the undeclared warfare of the Mediter-

ranean corsairs. Times of peace generally produced a gradual reduction in the

number of slaves: Lorenzo Bernardo reported in 1592 that the number of slaves in

Constantinople had dropped dramatically from eight or ten thousand to perhaps

three thousand. This drop was due, he believed, ‘‘to death, to escape, to ransom,

and to conversion.’’∑∞ Alvise Contarini in 1641 reported that where previously

three thousand slaves arrived annually in the city, now only about seven hundred

did, which made it more di≈cult to obtain their freedom. Another factor in the

ebb and ﬂow of slave numbers was the Muslim view that slavery was a temporary

state; thus the manumission of slaves was encouraged as an act of charity.∑≤

Actual length of captivity varied widely. In cases in which ransom funds were

readily available, and the location of a Venetian slave was known, ‘‘several months

were the minimum time necessary for obtaining liberation,’’ though the process

more often took several years. It seems, however, that much longer captivities

were the rule: one slave, a carpenter in the arsenal, was held for eighteen years

because of the demand for his skills. Another slave, taken at Famagosta, was held

twenty-two years and still another for twenty-six years.∑≥ Giacomo Nores, de-

scended from a Cypriot noble family, was enslaved ‘‘at a year and a half in the

arms of . . . his wet-nurse.’’ Fifteen years later Lorenzo Bernardo obtained his

release, and he eventually became Venice’s ‘‘chief interpreter’’ and married his

daughter to a patrician.∑∂

Though some lists have survived, it is di≈cult to establish with any accuracy

the actual number of Venetians among Constantinople’s slaves. In 1588, the

Senate estimated the number of Venetian captives in all the Mediterranean at

more than 2,500, a number perhaps still somewhat inﬂated by the large numbers

enslaved in the previous war.∑∑ One di≈culty in making estimates is that Otto-

mans who held Venetian slaves often attempted to hide them because according

to the capitulations, all Venetian slaves were to be freed into the baili’s custody as

soon as their identity became known. In practice, of course, this happened only

with great di≈culty. Ottoman masters, particularly the largest holder of the sul-

tan’s slaves in Constantinople, the kapudanpa¸sa, regularly went to great lengths to

keep the presence of enslaved Venetians hidden from o≈cials. Alvise Contarini

reported that Ottoman ship captains either kept their Venetian slaves outside the

city or locked up in their ships ‘‘so that they do not have recourse to the Bailo.’’

"
88,"74

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

The beylerbeyi of Tripoli ‘‘per prudenza immediately [sold] in Fez or in Algeria the

Venetian slaves that [he] captured, so as to avoid their being ransomed.’’∑∏

Conversely, the baili often resorted to subterfuge to free Venetian slaves as

quickly and inexpensively as possible, as the experience of Gianantonio Barozzi

suggests. Born a Venetian noble, at the age of sixteen in 1593 he was banished by

the Council of Ten ‘‘for a serious crime.’’ He ended up in Hungary ﬁghting as

a mercenary, was captured, enslaved, and taken to Constantinople by a janis-

sary captain who secret ly sequestered him. When word reached Marco Venier of

Barozzi’s plight, he was able to free him by hiding the boy’s identity as a Venetian

patrician (which would have led to a much higher ransom) and obtaining the

private intercession of a Venetian merchant as a cover for the bailo’s interest.∑π

Caring for and freeing slaves was, of course, one of the principal duties of the

baili; indeed, Alvise Contarini listed this as one of his greatest burdens. After 1586

the baili had at their disposal funds to ransom Venetian slaves, raised primarily by

the Provveditori sopra Ospedali e Luoghi Pii and the Scuola of the Santissima

Trinità. These resources attracted many slaves to Constantinople, including even

some who had renounced Christianity for Islam.∑∫ In order to qualify for the

funds available to the baili, a slave had to be either a patrician, citizen, or subject of

Venice or to have been taken captive while in the republic’s service. To verify

slaves’ eligibility for diplomatic and ﬁnancial assistance, the baili regularly held

inquiries into the circumstances of their capture.∑Ω Once freed, these ex-slaves

were often lodged and fed at the bailate, at least temporarily, which was a drain on

its resources. In certain cases, slaves received ﬁnancial assistance to obtain their

release and in return promised a certain period of service to pay o√ their debt.

Alessandro Pelegrini, slave of the ‘‘sultana of Piyale Pa ¸sa,’’ received funds to

purchase his liberty, as did a Donna Marietta. Both agreed to serve the bailo a

stipulated number of years in payment, until the debt was satisﬁed.∏≠

Even in legitimate cases that met the requirements for ﬁnancial assistance,

limited resources prevented the baili from freeing many Venetian slaves. In de-

ciding where to concentrate funds, patricians and citizens were always favored,

followed by Italian subjects; subjects from the Greek islands were often over-

looked. Marco Venier reported that corsair activity in the archipelago produced

large numbers of Cretan slaves, but his inability to pay for their freedom produced

‘‘the universal discontent of those peoples, who believe themselves almost gone

from the memory of their Prince, . . . Even though I do not fail to assist them as I

am able, . . . that which I should do I am not able.’’∏∞

Besides providing ﬁnancial assistance, the baili occasionally assisted slaves in

escaping; indeed, there was a secret passage in the bailate which was used to hide

"
89,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

75

slaves until they could be shipped to Candia or Zante. Alvise Contarini reported

having helped many slaves, Venetian and non-Venetian, to escape ‘‘without ever

any complaint, indeed not even a suspicion.’’ In one instance when a slave was

missing, his favorable reputation in the Porte led the grand vizier to state publicly

‘‘that the escapee might be hidden in any other place than in the house of the

bailo,’’ even though that, in fact, was where he was.∏≤ In general, however, the baili

avoided this practice, as overzealousness could land them in trouble. In the late

sixteenth century, in fact, the baili had the reputation, unwarranted they claimed,

of hiding slaves and spiriting them out of Constantinople. On at least two occa-

sions, the sultan wrote direct ly to the doge complaining about the actions of baili

in freeing slaves and requesting the diplomats’ immediate recall.∏≥

In addition to the baili, many members of the Venetian nation engaged in what

Braudel termed the ‘‘tra≈c in ransoms and the exchanges of men,’’ liberating

slaves for piety and proﬁt.∏∂ A 1616 dispatch reported that ship patrons and

scribes ‘‘drawn by greed for gain, without the knowledge of the Baili, hide slaves

in great numbers and of great consideration . . . and since this trade is very

perilous, one day some serious problem could happen.’’ In another instance,

several members of the embassy household were ordered to cease hiding slaves

there without permission.∏∑ Jewish merchants also played an important, though

not uncontroversial, role as middlemen in freeing Christian slaves. The terms of

this trade, at least in Venice, were that merchants worked through intermediaries

and earned a percentage on the ransom price, receiving the full sum only on

delivery of the slave.∏∏

However their freedom was obtained, as with the banditi, Venice was eager

that its slaves be removed from Constantinople as soon as possible, and for very

similar reasons: the fear that they might pass on crucial information or provide

services to their Ottoman masters or that they might convert to Islam. An exam-

ple of the former was Tommaso Venetiano, a carpenter in the arsenal, whom the

Ottomans refused to release for eighteen years because of the demand for his

skills. Lorenzo Bernardo eventually obtained his release by making a gift of sev-

eral sand-glasses to the kapudanpa¸sa.∏π The demand for skilled workers led the

kapudanpa¸sa to o√er artisans, carpenters, rope and sail makers, locksmiths, and

coopers their freedom in return for ten years of service, after which they would be

free to sett le and work in Constantinople or to return home. These sorts of

agreements were very common in the Ottoman Empire: Islamic jurisprudence

permitted these mukataba contracts, which allowed slaves to work independent ly

and apply earnings toward their ransom. Another option was to work a certain

period in return for freedom, in some ways a Mediterranean form of indentured

"
90,"76

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

servitude. Many urban craftsmen in the Ottoman Empire held slaves on these

terms, as has been shown in the Bursan silk industry. The system guaranteed the

owner good service for a certain period of time in return for manumission, which

was important since lifetime slaves were less productive.∏∫

Venice’s second concern was the increased potential for apostasy that captives

ran during long-term enslavement. This was particularly true in cases involving

young slaves, such as Pietro Cavazza, a cittadino originario whose father worked

for an important Venetian magistracy. Captured by corsairs at age fourteen and

sold to the kapudanpa¸sa, the lad was forcibly converted and circumcised. He

recounted this experience in a letter to his father: ‘‘Still being a child, and having

tender ﬂesh, and not being able to resist the great pain, I was forced to say that I

believed them, and I made myself a subject with my mouth, but maintaining my

heart consistent with my omnipresent God and our patron, whom I never aban-

doned, nor thinking of his divine majesty, will I ever abandon him.’’ Despite his

claims of coercion, his letter to his father also emphasizes the educational bene-

ﬁts he was enjoying as a result of his conversion, including learning to read and

write Turkish. ‘‘Here . . . I am not a scarf(i)aro nor am I a tailor; I do nothing but

read and write, praise be to God who gave me a litt le bit of a brain so that I know

how to read and write a bit in Turkish, and I do nothing but attend to exercising

that art which could be of use to me.’’∏Ω At his father’s request, the bailo tried to

free the boy, whose letter suggests that he may not have been entirely discon-

tented with his new life. Perhaps young Pietro hoped to translate his linguistic

experience into a lucrative position upon his release. Venice had something of a

welfare system for former slaves who returned to Christianity. A number of those

who learned Turkish, Arabic, Greek, and other more exotic languages were elec-

ted as sansari, or brokers, to assist Ottoman merchants trading in the lagoon.π≠

In most cases, slaves who obtained their freedom wanted to ﬂee Ottoman

lands and return home as quickly as possible. However, a certain number did

sett le in Constantinople following their releases, drawn by the possibilities that

the great city o√ered. A papal visitor in the 1580s found ﬁve hundred freed slaves

living in Galata and sixty more in Constantinople proper; a similar survey in 1630

found approximately the same numbers. These libertini often married and set up

houses throughout greater Constantinople, a visitor reported. ‘‘They live as sub-

jects of the Turk, and there are some of them who are very comfortable working in

industry and commerce,’’ as was the case with a group of libertini who began
trading wine after their release.π∞ ˙Inalcık’s ﬁndings support this: freed slaves

‘‘occupied an unusually important place in the economic life of Bursa as rich silk

"
91,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

77

manufacturers and merchants engaged in distant caravan trade, in money ex-

change, in usury and in tax farming.’’π≤

Because of their familiarity with the Ottoman world, these former slaves often

assumed roles as cultural intermediaries: Wenceslas Wratislaw mentions an Al-

fonso di Strada, a Spanish merchant and former slave sett led in Galata, who

helped free the imperial ambassador Frederic Kregwitz.π≥ During the bailate of

Marino Cavalli, one of Venice’s dragomans was a former slave who had been

freed by a previous bailo and who was in turn assigned the responsibility of

negotiating other slaves’ freedom. He also instructed the giovani della lingua,

though he left Venetian service in 1559, citing poor pay.π∂

These libertini existed in the interstices of the Ottoman and Venetian commu-

nities, and their political and religious identity was not always immediately appar-

ent, nor necessarily ﬁxed. It was not uncommon for libertini who sett led in Con-

stantinople to have recourse to both the kadı and the bailo on commercial and

other matters. It was also not uncommon for former slaves, after marrying a local

woman and raising a family, to return to die in Christian lands. There are also

cases of slaves escaping to Europe and then subsequent ly returning to their

owners. In other instances, slaves who obtained their freedom remained in the

service of their former Ottoman masters. After purchasing his freedom, Pietro

Brea, became ‘‘scribe of the slaves to ‘Ul ¯ug ‘Al¯ı.’’ He learned Turkish and customs

of the land, and when he eventually left Constantinople, he soon returned to the

city in the pay of the king of Spain.π∑

Slaves and the libertini, then, constitute another element of the larger Venetian

community in Constantinople that might at any given time have comprised hun-

dreds, if not thousands, of patricians, citizens, and subjects. The nation felt a

responsibility to obtain the freedom of these unfortunate men and women and

often went to great expense and e√ort to do so. As with the banditi, slaves repre-

sented a burden for the baili, but they also provided certain critical services. Once

freed, some former slaves remained in Constantinople and even sett led down,

some working direct ly with the nation, others becoming Ottoman subjects but

never renouncing entirely their Venetian identity.

g r e e k s

Of the several di√erent groups existing on the margins of the o≈cial nation,

the most numerous were the Greek subjects of Venice, that is the culturally and

linguistically Greek inhabitants of the islands of the stato da mar. In the late

"
92,"78

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

sixteenth century Venice’s Greek Orthodox subjects numbered 480,000, almost

20 percent of the empire’s total population.π∏ The label of Greek-Venetian is a

shorthand, of course, which masks the great diversity that characterized Greek

speakers in the early modern Mediterranean. While Venice’s policy regarding the

Greek-Venetians in the Ottoman Empire was not fundamentally di√erent than

that toward banditi and slaves, Venetian authorities seem to have recognized, and

perhaps accepted, the deeper causes of the signiﬁcant Greek exodus to Con-

stantinople and in the end did litt le to prevent it. Indeed, the baili e√ectively

facilitated the presence of these men and women in the Ottoman Empire by

annually providing them with a certiﬁcation of their status as Venetian subjects,

which carried with it important economic and legal rights. The Venetian chancel-

lery also supplied other important services to these subjects, adjudicated their

disputes, and furnished some with employment in the embassy and the commer-

cial wing of the nation.

Venice’s ties with eastern Mediterranean Greek culture dated back to the city’s

early status as an outpost of the Byzantine Empire and its later role in the blos-

soming Levantine trade. With the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Venice extracted from

the Byzantine emperors a series of island and mainland possessions, which pro-

vided the foundation of the city’s near monopoly of Levantine commerce in the

later Middle Ages. This eastern empire, the stato da mar, was expanded after 1204

through conquest, purchase, and dynastic succession.ππ The rise of the Ottomans,

however, set in motion a gradual waning in Venice’s presence and inﬂuence in

the region. In the two centuries following the conquest of Constantinople, Venice

progressively lost many of its Aegean and Ionian possessions: by the end of the

War of the Holy League in 1573, a ‘‘turning point in the history of the Stato da

mar,’’ as one historian has described it, Venice’s holdings in the Mediterranean

were reduced to a few small islands—Zante, Kíthira, Cephalonia, Corfu, Tínos,

and, most important ly, Crete.π∫

Crete, or Candia as it was called by contemporaries after the principal city of

the island (modern-day H ¯erákleion), was considered the ‘‘the loveliest crown that

adorns the head of the Most Serene Republic,’’ and indeed it was the largest of the

stato da mar possessions, with a population of around 160,000 in 1571, compris-

ing about a third of stato da mar ’s total population.πΩ Candia was one of Venice’s

earliest possessions, acquired in 1204 and held until the Ottoman conquest in

1669. A strategic linchpin in Venetian defenses, the island was also important for

its agricultural production, particularly its famous wines, and as a market for

Venetian goods. Additionally, Candia in many ways functioned as the backbone of

"
93,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

79

Venice’s commercial empire, serving as a crucial stop on Venice’s Levantine

shipping routes.∫≠

The island of Candia was unique in that it was the only possession of the stato

da mar that Venice attempted in any systematic way to colonize, a process that led

to numerous popular revolts that earned the island the reputation of the most

di≈cult area of the empire to govern.∫∞ Colonization e√orts met with limited

success, however, and the Venetian families that sett led on the island over time

became Hellenized and e√ectively assimilated into the much larger Greek Ortho-

dox population, creating something akin to a composite Veneto-Cretan culture.

By the sixteenth century, part ly in response to Ottoman encroachments in the

stato da mar, Venice adopted a more tolerant policy and treated Crete as an integral

part of the larger Venetian state, rather than a colony.∫≤ This shift signaled a tacit

acknowledgment by Venice of the necessity for local support in retaining its hold

on the island, which was especially clear after the loss of Cyprus in 1571.

It has been argued that this liberalization of Venetian policy resulted in a

Cretan renaissance. An urban class began to arise in the chief cities of the island,

with a commensurate rise in commerce and shipping, which produced an in-

crease in living standards and a cultural ﬂowering.∫≥ This boom was relatively

brief, however, and the shipping sector began to decline signiﬁcant ly by 1600.

Additionally, Crete was a predominant ly rural society, thus most Cretans did not

beneﬁt direct ly from this urban economic expansion; in the countryside peasants

still lived in abject misery. They were exploited by feudal lords and often pressed

into service by Venetian authorities on the republic’s galleys and public works,

especially the island’s massive fortiﬁcations built in the latter sixteenth century.

Other factors contributed to misery on Crete: signiﬁcant tracts of land originally

planted in grain were switched to grapes to supply the lucrative wine trade,

producing chronic grain shortages. Piracy paralyzed shipping, and seven major

outbreaks of plague between 1570 and 1645, exacerbated the situation. As one

Venetian o≈cial reported in 1589, ‘‘anyone who has not seen the wretchedness of

those people is unable to believe it.’’∫∂

Because of the harshness of the dominante’s policies, rural peasants were often

antagonistic towards their Venetian masters in a way that urban Cretans were not.

One observer noted that the peasants ‘‘considering that it is not possible to sink

into a worse state than that in which they live today, burst into cries of pain

and despair . . . Some of them, contemplating their wretchedness and lamenting

their fate, have uttered these words: ‘In the end we shall prefer to go and ﬁnd

those dogs,’ meaning that they will prefer to go and live in Turkish regions.’’∫∑

This was not an idle threat: during the previous war when an Ottoman force

brieﬂy landed on the island, peasants revolted and even attempted to join with the

invaders.

The desperate conditions of their islands drove many Greek-Venetians to mi-

grate to Ottoman lands, as well as Venice and other European cities.∫∏ In Constan-

tinople they found work in the cloth industries, in shipyards, and often with the

Venetian nation. The number of immigrants was signiﬁcant: Matteo Zane wrote,

‘‘so many Levantine subjects are in this city . . . that I remain truly amazed.’’ While

no precise record remains, contemporary estimates give some indication of their

numbers: Leonardo Donà, in 1595, calculated that in Galata alone there were two

thousand Greek-Venetian subjects; Simone Contarini in 1612 put the number at

over three thousand subjects, most ly from Candia. These estimates are probably

inaccurate as they include only those subjects who, in order to avoid paying the

harac, annually registered in the bailate’s chancellery. Behind these numbers

there certainly existed many more Greek-Venetians who quiet ly assimilated into

the capital’s large Greek population.∫π

Many Greek-Venetians came to Constantinople intending to remain only

brieﬂy, and they retained ownership of houses and farms on Candia. If their

original intention was to seek their fortune and then return home, many ended

up staying in the city for extended periods. As Leonardo Donà reported, they came

‘‘to earn a living’’ with the intention of returning home but gradually sett led

down, married, and had children and made the Ottoman Empire ‘‘almost their

patria.’’ Paolo Contarini in 1581 wrote of ‘‘many Candiots with wives and chil-

dren who have lived in these parts for ﬁfteen years’’; Ottaviano Bon described

‘‘subjects . . . from the island of Candia and Tínos . . . the more part aged with

wives and children, so that they do not think any more of returning to their

Patria.’’∫∫

The experience of Francesco Calogna from Rettimo was probably quite com-

mon. He was seventy years old and resided in Constantinople with his wife,

‘‘living in great comfort.’’ He gave two houses in Rettimo to his sister’s sons,

indication of his intent to live out his remaining years in the Ottoman capital.∫Ω In

another case, a man who had sett led with his wife in Constantinople turned over

two houses on Crete to his father-in-law. Transfers of property to relatives such as

these were very common among the acts of the baili, to the point that the chancel-

lery appears to have served as something of a real estate o≈ce for Greek-Venetian

subjects in Constantinople.Ω≠

On their arrival in the Ottoman capital, the Greek subjects of Venice found

work in a variety of sectors. Simone Contarini reported that the expatriates were

"
95,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

81

‘‘for the most part sailors, coopers, shoemakers, and grocers.’’Ω∞ A Venetian docu-

ment of 1627, listing ‘‘Tinots and Candiots living in Constantinople and their

professions,’’ supports this assertion: it lists eighty men divided according to

profession and place of origin. Forty-nine came from the Venetian island of

Tínos; most of the rest from Candia. Of those whose profession was speciﬁed,

seventeen worked as coopers, three as sailors, one a shoemaker, and one was

listed as a beggar. The majority of this group, however, worked in the woolen

industry— forty-one of the sixty-one whose jobs were indicated.Ω≤ The number of

men listed as involved in shipping and shipbuilding is certainly low, and the

census was not intended to be exhaustive, as a number of baili reported that men

from Candia ‘‘make up a great part of the workers in the Turk’s arsenal.’’Ω≥ So

numerous were the Greek-Venetian subjects in the arsenal that they organized

themselves into at least one guild, the Arte del Bottaro. Other Greek-Venetians

entered into contracts of apprenticeship with young men from the islands. A man

from Candia living in Galata, for instance, accepted custody of a thirteen-year-old

boy from Canea ‘‘with the obligation to maintain him, to clothe him, and to pro-

vide him with shoes for the space of two continuous years, and to teach him the

barber’s art.’’ The documents record Greek-Venetian clockmakers, merchants,

tradesmen, and storekeepers, such as Dimitri Carpoforo who was in business

with an uncle and had a bottega in Galata and one in Candia.Ω∂

In addition to trades, Constantinople was the focus of a thriving commerce in

Cretan agricultural products— lemons, oranges, olives, oil, wax, honey, cotton,

raisins, fruit, and cheeses. The most sought after and lucrative product of the

island, however, was its wines. Malvasia, muscatels, and sweet wines all were in

great demand in Constantinople and were carried from there into the Black Sea

and beyond into Poland, Russia, and even as far as Calicut where Vasco da Gama’s

men found barrels of malvasia for sale in 1498.Ω∑ All of the trade that ﬂowed into

Constantinople was subject, at least in theory, to paying Venetian cottimi, and

while there was much tax evasion, still the income from Greek commerce was not

insigniﬁcant. Despite the good tax return on this trade, the Signoria and the baili

pursued a policy, if inconsistent ly, intent on discouraging its Greek subjects from

coming to Constantinople.

One reason for this policy was to control the ﬂow of news into the Ottoman

capital. Because of the sensitivity of their task, the baili wanted to monopolize

information and to have the independence to put whatever spin on it would

beneﬁt their negotiations. The Cretans represented a dangerous, uncontrollable

source of information on the islands. Some passed intelligence along innocent ly:

Giovanni Correr complained that ‘‘because of the continual commerce that the

"
96,"82

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Candiots have in Constantinople, the ships that come and go are very frequent,

and as soon as one arrives, the passengers and the merchants are interrogated by

renegades, and by other people they know who buy their goods, concerning

goings on in Candia, and if the harvest has been or it appears will be good, and

other similar inquiries. These men respond, [and] immediately it is publicized

and discussed that because of that shortage of foodstu√s, [the Ottomans] ought to

conquer Candia.’’Ω∏ Giovanni Mocenigo believed the miserable situation of the

Cretan peasantry represented a serious security risk because loud complaints

about their bad treatment might incite an Ottoman intervention, ‘‘as the expe-

rience . . . of Cyprus may have taught us.’’Ωπ Gianfrancesco Morosini expressed

concerns that expatriates in Constantinople sought to weaken the Venetian hold

on the island by passing along the plans of Candia’s defenses and spreading

rumors that its people were on the verge of rebellion ‘‘because they are not less

tyrannized than were the Cypriots, a≈rming that a few great and rich men are

those who keep the people su√ocated.’’Ω∫ Two hundred years of shared history

with the Ottomans, combined with the recent loss of Cyprus, made Venice very

aware of the fragility of its hold over its few remaining stato da mar possessions.ΩΩ

Avoiding controversy and complications was another motivation for Venice to

keep its subjects out of Constantinople. Alvise Contarini maintained that the Cre-

tans caused more trouble to Venice’s representatives than did the Ottomans: they

were always ﬁghting with Muslims, Greek-Ottoman subjects, the customs of-

ﬁcers, or among themselves. None of these problems were unique to the Greeks;

members of the nation, both o≈cial and uno≈cial, regularly created similar

disturbances. Probably it was the sheer numbers of the Greek-Venetian subjects

that contributed to this impression, though some among the Venetian patriciate

did believe that because ‘‘the nature of the Greeks is extremely cruel and savage,’’

they were more inclined to create problems.∞≠≠ In one case, in which a Cretan

‘‘broke a Jew’s head open,’’ the bailo ﬁned the man, and the matter seemed closed.

But the injured Jew carried the issue to the divan, and it was resolved only with

some di≈culty and expense of political and ﬁnancial capital. In another instance,

a Cretan suspected of piracy was turned in by Greek subjects of the sultan, and

once again the bailo was drawn into the fray.∞≠∞

Venice’s fears that their discontented subjects would revolt were also projected

onto those Greeks living in Constantinople. When a wealthy man banished from

Candia for killing a farmer came to the city, the bailo quickly issued him a safe-

conduct so he could plead his case in Venice, which he granted ‘‘judging it more

than necessary to remove from these lands such a person who has the following

of all the Candiots that are here, and trying to quiet the noise that was being

"
97,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

83

made’’ regarding his case. The man apparent ly had won the sympathies of his

fellow expatriates by lamenting the su√erings of his ﬁve children, ‘‘which things

are not only heard willingly here, but are caressed and fomented great ly by the

Turks.’’∞≠≤

In addition to these security risks, the Greek presence created problems of a

more economic nature, such as the thriving contraband trade between Constanti-

nople and Candia. One Cretan ship was intercepted by Ottoman authorities carry-

ing contraband ﬁsh. A 1592 dispatch to the Venetian Inquisitori di stato reported

that certain Ottomans and Greeks were taking vegetables and other foodstu√s to

Candia in small boats, which they traded secret ly for sword blades and other

prohibited goods. The modus operandi was ‘‘to let a man ashore, who then with a

small boat carries the merchandise to their great proﬁt . . . I believe that no ship

from Christianity turns up here that does not carry arms of diverse sorts for

merchandise.’’∞≠≥ As this intelligence report indicated, smuggling was not solely a

Greek problem, but there was an impression, accurate or not, that the Greeks

were widely involved in it. Because they were not allowed to participate actively in

the life of the nation, Greek-Venetian traders may have been less opposed to

working outside the vale of the nation’s regulations. This certainly was the case

with a Cretan ship patron who was caught trying to smuggle three slaves from

Constantinople, something the nation’s o≈cials had warned him against ‘‘many

times . . . as he was accustomed to doing similar things.’’∞≠∂

Besides smuggling activities, Venetian authorities were vexed by the Greek-

Venetian merchants’ persistent evasion of consular duties and fees. This became

such a problem that in 1615, Venice e√ectively acknowledged its inability to police

its own subjects when it requested that the sultan issue an extraordinary com-

mand to the kadı of Gallipoli and the Castellans of the fortresses at the mouth of

the Dardanelles, ordering them to ensure that Cretan ships leaving Constanti-

nople for Venetian territories paid their ten ducat duty to the consul of Gallipoli.

The order stated that to avoid paying their duties, ‘‘they depart from here and exit

past the mouth of the Cast les without saying a word or making anything known.’’

Any ship that refused was to be detained by these Ottoman o≈cials.∞≠∑

To avoid these and other problems, Venice’s policy was ﬁrst to discourage the

Greek-Venetians from sett ling in Ottoman lands and, failing this, to encourage

them to leave as quickly as possible. Venetian o≈cials experimented with a vari-

ety of solutions— some prescriptive, others proscriptive— to stanch the continual

hemorrhage of subjects. One governor of Candia, to prevent Cretan banditi from

leaving for the Ottoman Empire, set aside a space where they could remain on the

island in a sort of internal exile. This did not prove particularly e√ective because

"
98,"84

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

‘‘this place is at times restricted so great ly, that the bandito, perhaps being poor,

unable to ﬁnd a way to sustain himself and earn a living in that place, he must, so

as not to die of hunger, leave the island.’’∞≠∏ In another attempt in 1606, the

Senate directed Ottaviano Bon to encourage the men of Candia and Tínos work-

ing in the arsenal in Constantinople to return to Candia with the promise that

there was much work to do in the island’s arsenal arming twenty galleys and that

afterward there would be work as sailors and workers on these ships. In this way

‘‘the opportunity to move themselves from home and to return to Turkish lands

will be removed.’’ To encourage their return, the bailo was permitted to make

small donations to o√set expenses and to give safe-conducts to any banditi among

their number.∞≠π

These attempts suggest that Venice was aware of the economic causes that

drove so many to Constantinople, though the appropriate response was much

debated. The root of the problem seemed quite simple, as one bailo indicated to

the Senate: ‘‘I found that in reality they came here because they did not have

provisions on the islands.’’ Another made clear why this was the case: they ‘‘do not

have sustenance and are not able to live by their art.’’∞≠∫ Alvise Priuli, on his return

from duty in Candia, concurred with this view. In his opinion men went to

Constantinople seeking work because they had such irregular employment and

low wages in Candia that they were unable to feed themselves. The way to stop

this outﬂow was to construct more ships in the arsenal there, and to pay a fair

wage. In Constantinople workers in the arsenal started at eight akçe, but special-

ized men could rise as high as one hundred akçe a day.∞≠Ω Another Cretan o≈cial

reported that the number of skilled artisans in the arsenal there had plummeted

to ﬁfteen caulkers and seventeen carpenters, due in part to the plague, but more

to the shortage of ships and shipbuilding on the island: ‘‘Not ﬁnding, therefore,

either work or shipping, nor even work in the arsenals, all the men in these

industries decide to hunt for a living in other parts, and especially Constanti-

nople.’’∞∞≠ He too suggested the solution was to build more ships and maintain

them in Candia’s arsenal. The Senate’s response was that this was impossible:

Candia’s depressed shipping industry was part of a much larger problem a√ecting

the whole empire, due in part to overexploitation of its limited forest reserves.∞∞∞

The shortage of ships, combined with an oversupply of sailors, produced a dias-

pora of Cretan seamen, many of whom went to work on Ottoman ships.∞∞≤

One byproduct of the shortage of work in the islands was piracy, which re-

sulted in regular diplomatic di≈culties for Venice and its baili in Constantinople.

Alvise Giustinian, proveditor generale in Candia, reported in 1591 that due to the

lack of legitimate shipping work, Greek men regularly went into the archipelago

"
99,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

85

to prey on Ottoman subjects. When some of these men were captured and a trial

ensued it was discovered that there were ‘‘many, many interested parties, and thus

this represented a matter of great consideration, because the desire to castigate all

the guilty would be to destroy all that people [the Candiots] whom Your Lordships

esteem highly, and of whom you have great need. And castigating a part and

leaving the other part unpunished would be an injustice.’’∞∞≥ The solution: build

more ships so that men would have work and not resort to illegal activities.

It would be inaccurate, however, to imply that o≈cials were interested solely in

ridding Constantinople of its Greek-Venetian subjects. The Signoria and the baili

turned a blind eye to the presence and activities of Greek subjects, and indeed

even acted in ways that facilitated and thus encouraged their remaining in the city.

One reason was that the co√ers of the baili, which su√ered from the reduction in

the o≈cial nation’s long-distance trade in the early seventeenth century, desper-

ately needed the customs duties and other fees that these Greek subjects paid. The

Venetian mission in Constantinople also relied on the foodstu√s, especially wine,

that Cretan merchants provided. Greek-Venetians resident in Constantinople also

provided many services crucial to the functioning of the diplomatic and commer-

cial nation, particularly in treating and working cloth. And ﬁnally, though a point

of contention, the Ottoman Empire served as something of a release valve toward

which problem-makers among the poor and disa√ected of Venice’s island posses-

sions could be directed.

It is something of an irony, given the energy and resources expended in trying

to prevent Greek subjects from leaving the islands, that once they arrived in

Constantinople the baili facilitated their residency there and that these migrants

became extensively involved in the activities of the larger Venetian community.

Despite the problems that their presence created, and the attempts by Venice to

get them to leave, the uno≈cial subjects and the o≈cial Venetian nation were

interconnected, as each furnished the other with necessary services and support.

The Venetian chancellery provided for Greek-Venetians the same sorts of func-

tions it did for the o≈cial community: registering wills and testaments, admin-

istering justice, registering sales of properties, providing deposit services, and so

forth. In addition, because of their status as Venetian subjects, the Greeks were

also able to use the Latin-rite hospital in Galata.∞∞∂

The baili, as leaders of the Venetian community, served as arbitrators in resolv-

ing guild labor disputes, despite their opposition to Greek-Venetian involvement

in Ottoman industries. In a particularly revealing instance, twelve members of

the Coopers Guild, all from Rettimo, appeared before the bailo and stated, ‘‘as

subjects of the most serene Signoria they desired to have as headmaster of their

"
100,"86

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

guild one of your subjects, not wanting any more that man who at present ex-

ercises that o≈ce named Constantin from Rhodes, a Turkish subject, because of

the many tyrannies done to them.’’∞∞∑ In Constantin’s place the Rettimites elected

one of their own compatriots, a certain Giorgi from Rettimo. That men providing

a skilled trade to the Ottomans, against the wishes of their Venetian lords, had no

qualms about appearing before the bailo to resolve their dispute gives some

indication of the unusual relationship between the o≈cial and uno≈cial ele-

ments of community.

Most important of all the services the baili rendered, however, and the one that

permitted the Greek-Venetian subjects to retain their legal status despite their

extended sojourns in Constantinople, was the annual issuance of fedi. The fede

was a legal document issued by the chancellery which attested to the status of the

resident Greek men and women as Venetian subjects. Though these were Vene-

tian certiﬁcations, Ottoman institutions accepted them as valid, legally binding

documents and as proof that the bearer was indeed a Venetian subject and there-

fore not subject to the special taxes required of all non-Muslim, dhimmi subjects

of the sultan. In addition, the fede ensured that the baili’s court would be the

ultimate authority in legal and other matters involving the bearer. These docu-

ments were issued in great numbers, often at the beginning of each year when

lines of subjects would appear at the embassy to have their papers renewed. While

occasionally a Venetian or Italian subject from the terraferma might appear, the

vast majority of these documents were issued to people from the Greek islands.∞∞∏

Venetian authorities jealously defended both the rights of Greek-Venetian sub-

jects before Ottoman o≈cials and their jurisdiction over them. Attempts to declare

long-term inhabitants Ottoman subjects, especially if they married a local man or

woman, so that o≈cials might collect the harac, were repeatedly fended o√ by the

baili’s diplomatic e√orts.∞∞π As Venetian subjects, the baili also held legal authority

over the Greek-Venetians, a right they protected vigorously. One evening, while

Simone Contarini was out walking, ‘‘a great number of Candiot subjects came to

me complaining strongly that while they were making fun of a certain Greek from

here in Galata, he complained to one of the Ministers of this place, who com-

manded that two of them be put down and beaten according to the local cus-

tom.’’∞∞∫ Contarini sent his dragoman to the divan to request that the minister that

had done this be punished, to which the vizier immediately agreed, and he further

rea≈rmed that all Venetian subjects would be sent to the baili for such matters.

Venice’s jurisdiction over its subjects, as well as those subjects’ Venetian identity,

was recognized and often respected by individuals outside the nation, as in the

case of a Ottoman-Jewish merchant who bought some Cretan wine for ‘‘important

"
101,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

87

people,’’ which was delivered watered down. He appeared before bailo as the

Cretan merchant’s ‘‘Prince . . . not desiring to seek any other Justice.’’∞∞Ω

The baili also protected the commercial activity of its Greek subjects in the

Ottoman Empire. Lorenzo Bernardo described one case in which a Jewish Cretan

customs o≈cial and an inﬂuential Ottoman Jew, David Passi, tried to block the

many vessels from Candia that passed through Constantinople on their way to

Poland-Lithuania with wine, in an attempt to monopolize this trade for them-

selves. Bernardo took this matter before the grand vizier, ‘‘for the beneﬁt of these

poor men [the Candiots] and much more for the dignity of Your Serenity.’’ He

pointed out ‘‘the ancient usage, that it has always been customary for their per-

sonal vessels to pass into the Black Sea’’ after paying duties of 7 1⁄2 ducats per barrel

of wine. The bailo was eventually able to obtain an imperial commandment

ordering the Jewish customs o≈cials to leave the Cretan merchants alone.∞≤≠

In another case, a man from Canea died on a ship belonging to the kapudan-

pa¸sa, and the sixty-three barrels of wine he had loaded on an Ottoman caramousal

were conﬁscated by several o≈cials who claimed them. The bailo intervened and

was able to save the Greek’s goods, just as he would have for any deceased, o≈cial

merchant of the nation. Another way the o≈cial nation both assisted and bene-

ﬁted from the uno≈cial was through the bestowal of o≈cial, but menial, posi-

tions within the nation. For example a Tiniot who had worked in the cloth indus-

try for twenty years in Constantinople was elected as a cernitore ordinario by the

Council of Twelve, as was a Cypriot who had been working in the same industry

for thirty years.∞≤∞

The relationship, then, between the o≈cial nation and the much more nu-

merous Greek-Venetians of the uno≈cial nation was quite uneven. Ottaviano

Bon summarized quite well this unusual situation: ‘‘I have observed that in Con-

stantinople are found inﬁnite artisans and many work-people who work as car-

penters and as caulkers, subjects of Your Lordship from the island of Candia and

Tínos who work indi√erent ly both in the Arsenal and outside . . . These live as

subjects of the Most Serene Republic so as not to pay the ordinary harac, and not

to be subjected to other taxes. They preserve themselves [from this] with a bolletino

that is made for them by the baili witnessing that they are subjects, which they

renew every year for their greater security.’’∞≤≤

Bon was careful about distributing these bollettini or fedi in an e√ort to encour-

age the Greek subjects to return home, and he argued that the Senate ought to

provide ‘‘some recompense to make them stay in Candia.’’ Venice’s Greek sub-

jects left the islands, he held, because ‘‘they do not have employment and they

cannot live on their trade.’’ The great beneﬁt of this steady stream of people went

"
102,"88

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

to the ‘‘Turks who use them on their galleys as rowers and workers, making them

obey by force,’’ and in the arsenal and other industries. ‘‘The worst thing,’’ in

Bon’s view, ‘‘is that they are so weakly ediﬁed in religion, that for every litt le

unpleasant encounter in which there is danger to life or some other interest, they

easily become Turks.’’ Yet, Bon reported, despite these conditions, the Greek-

Venetians still loved Venice and held ‘‘Saint Mark in their hearts.’’∞≤≥

Perhaps there was an element of wishful thinking in Bon’s ﬁnal observation

that the Greek-Venetian subjects in Constantinople still held Venice dear. In

many ways, the Greeks illustrate the complexity and variability of nation and

identity in early modern Constantinople. By going to the Ottoman capital, these

men and women were voicing discontent with Venice and Venetian rule in their

homelands. Yet in Constantinople many of them became even more dependent

on their status as Venetian subjects. By identifying themselves as recognized,

card-carrying members of the Venetian community they were able to avoid being

subsumed into the much larger population of Greek-Ottoman subjects. Though

religiously and linguistically Greek, the Cretans distinguished themselves from

their cultural and linguistic ‘‘nation’’ and played an integral and reciprocal role in

the life of the o≈cial nation in Constantinople. The multiple layers of their iden-

tity allowed them to move with reasonable ease between Greek, Ottoman, and

Venetian poles.

r e l i g i o u s , w om e n , a n d o th e r s o n
th e m a r g i n s o f th e n a t i o n

The Greek subjects, slaves, and banditi represented the bulk of the uno≈cial

nation, but there were also present in Constantinople a number of Venetians—

citizens and subjects—who ﬁt into none of these categories. These include re-

ligious, small-scale merchants and tradesmen, women, and a variety of others

who existed on the margins of the Venetian community.

By the post-Lepanto era, the Latin-rite community of Galata (which will be

examined in detail in chapter 5) had shrunk to a mere shadow of its former self.

Few religious remained to serve in the churches and monasteries of the city, and

many of those who did hailed from lands subject to Venice. One church o≈cial

wrote that the ﬁve or six monks in the church of San Pietro were ‘‘for the most

part from the state of Venice’’ and barely survived on the income of the church

supplemented by gifts from the baili.∞≤∂ The bailo in 1632 reported that in the

convent of Santa Maria di Galata all the monks were Venetian subjects. Indeed,

the patriarchal vicar, the most senior Roman Catholic o≈cial responsible for the

"
103,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

89

church in the Ottoman capital, was for many years almost always a Venetian

because of the city’s traditional role as protector of the Latin churches in the

Ottoman Empire.∞≤∑ This primacy was challenged in the seventeenth century by

the French, but accepted practice remained that the religious were under the

jurisdiction of their prince’s legate.∞≤∏ This is clear from an incident in 1632 in

which a Bergamasque monk was punished for disrupting his monastery; both the

French ambassador and the patriarchal vicar readily admitted the bailo’s authority

to discipline the man because he was a Venetian subject.∞≤π

That these prelates were Venetian did not necessarily mean that they favored

their sovereign’s interests. One vicar, Giuseppe Bruni, was from Venice but ‘‘de-

pendent entirely on the Jesuits.’’ A ‘‘Brescian friar’’ attempted to spy on the

Venetian embassy on behalf of the Holy Roman emperor. Almoro Nani rather

sweepingly decried the activities of the religious community in Constantinople,

‘‘who for the most part are out-of-control carts who come down here either to live

after their own fashion, licentiously, or also moved by a spirit of ambition they

procure to advance themselves in Rome and other places by examining the dis-

patches of the Porte.’’ Certain church o≈cials shared this view as well.∞≤∫

More numerous than the few remaining religious were men and women who

came to Constantinople of their own will for motivations quite similar to those of

the Greek-Venetians: the hope of improving their social and economic position.

Many came to work in the Ottoman cloth and shipping industries; there were al-

ways numerous specialized artisans from Venice and the terraferma who worked

in the sultans’ shipyards. Pietro Zen, early in the sixteenth century, complained of

the ‘‘caulkers, carpenters, and other such’’ who came from Christian lands and
provided critical technological assistance to the Ottomans. ˙Inalcık has found that

by the mid-sixteenth century in the Kasımpa ¸sa arsenal district of Galata, the

majority of the skilled workmen were Christians, Greeks, or Venetians.∞≤Ω Many

other Venetian tradesmen were attracted to the city to ply their crafts, too.

One commercial sector that continued to be lucrative for Venetian Levantine

exports was precious stones. A number of Venetian jewelers lived and worked in

Constantinople, including Sebastian Danese who lived there for years with his

three children. At Danese’s death he left land and houses in Venice to his daugh-

ter Moisa, who had married into an important Ottoman Latin-rite family.∞≥≠ There

was an ongoing demand for jewelers and goldsmiths in Constantinople: Morde-

cai Cressi, described as a ‘‘Venetian-Jew,’’ arranged to bring a goldsmith from

Venice ‘‘with the promise that he would have the opportunity to work and make

great proﬁts.’’ Another man agreed to teach a Portuguese Jew l’arte del diamanter

and to provide him with raw materials in return for his assistance.∞≥∞

"
104,"90

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Other specialized artisans also worked in Constantinople, such as the furrier

Giacomo Frieste from Venice. A man from Bergamo maintained a hosteria in

Galata, and though he was not an o≈cial member of the nation, he submitted

himself to the baili’s authority in return for their defense and protection of his

interests. In the ﬁrst decades of the century, Sanudo mentions the presence in

Constantinople of a number of ‘‘lower-class Venetian subjects . . . artisans, shoe-

makers, tailors, and tavern keepers,’’ as well as doctors, surgeons, apothecaries,

and watchmakers.∞≥≤

There were also merchants who traded in Constantinople, as we have seen, but

not under the auspices of the o≈cial trading nation. The testament of Iseppo

Sanzonio from near Bergamo, who died in Galata in 1627 leaving a pregnant wife

and three daughters in the city, gives us a picture of the networks of a merchant

outside the o≈cial nation. In partnership with a Venetian dragoman, he carried

on a signiﬁcant trade, principally in jewels, from Venice to the Black Sea and

Moldavia. His commercial circles included a recent ly naturalized Venetian citizen

from Salò, as well as another paesano from Bergamo, who traded in the Black Sea

for ﬁsh and who was also not a member of the o≈cial nation.∞≥≥

As in the case of the Greek-Venetians, these uno≈cial men (and some women)

were often supported and subsidized by the o≈cial community, in e√ect facilitat-

ing their continued presence. In 1596, for example, Marco Venier conceded to

one such man ‘‘that you may make good bread, enough for this our household,

and for all our merchants, and others of our subjects, but being in no way able to

sell it to Turks, nor to Perots, nor to any haracgüzar.’’∞≥∂ This man had accom-

panied Marco Venier to Constantinople and married a Chioggian woman living in

Galata who served as the embassy’s washerwoman. Eventually both left Con-

stantinople in 1603, but by 1606 another Venetian subject, ‘‘Francesco Padoan,

baker in Galata,’’ was ﬁlling this role.∞≥∑

The reciprocally beneﬁcial relationship between o≈cial and uno≈cial nation

is particularly evident in the experience of Venice’s cernitori, or appraisers. Cerni-

tori were o≈cially sanctioned functionaries of the nation, charged with appraising

the quality of merchandise and ﬁnalizing sales of cloth, leather, and other goods

traded by the o≈cial merchants. They were especially important in transactions

involving raw wool: they ensured the quality of the wool, and that it was not damp,

as this ruined the material and could damage other merchandise loaded with it.

Cernitori were assisted in their activities by several argati, or porters, who carried

the heavy merchandise and might assist in its appraisal. Though they were not

o≈cially members of the nation, the cernitori played an important regulatory role

"
105,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

in its trade. Venice’s merchants were obligated to trade only through the nation’s

o≈cial cernitori, who were required to keep wool and other goods under lock and

key until they had veriﬁed the weight and quality of the merchandise. Following

this, the cernitori sealed the bundles of merchandise with an o≈cial seal and

registered the transaction in the Venetian chancellery. As a further level of over-

sight, merchants were required to ship their goods only on Venetian ships, and

captains were forbidden to receive any goods that did not have the o≈cial seal. In

return for their services, cernitori typically received a 1– 2 percent commission on

the value of the goods.∞≥∏ Cernitori were almost always subjects, not citizens, and

their presence in Constantinople was almost never legally endorsed. Yet their

services were vital to the commercial activities of the nation, as well as the collec-

tion of duties that were the lifeblood of the Venetian bailate.∞≥π

Indeed, the cernitori ’s unusual status vis-à-vis the nation is evident in the

process by which one was elected a cernitore pubblico. To be considered, an aspi-

rant required an acceptable guarantor and approval of the Council of Twelve. The

nation’s merchants often maneuvered to place someone they favored, such as one

of their giovini, or even the bailo’s cavaliere, in one of these highly sought after

positions. In most cases, cernitori had to be Venetian subjects, though in some

areas where this was impossible, non-Venetians were elected.∞≥∫ A recurring

problem was that the nation’s merchants would use unauthorized cernitori, espe-

cially Armenians, Jews, and even Muslims, an infraction punishable by a ﬁne of

one hundred ducats. Finding qualiﬁed individuals in Constantinople was not an

issue, however, and indeed the positions were in such great demand that with

Venice’s diminishing Levantine trade after 1600, a glut of cernitori resulted and a

number of initiatives were proposed to limit their numbers. These met with

limited success, however, as the positions were seen as a form of social assistance

for needy, unsanctioned members of the community.∞≥Ω

While not heritable, families tried to maintain a hold on the positions, which

were often passed from father to son. Bernardin Corniani, a Venetian citizen

from an established family, ﬁrst appeared in Constantinople in 1590 and was

soon elected as a cernitore. Corniani owned a house in Venice which he rented out,

and he left behind his wife and at least one daughter, to whom he eventually

provided a dowry of twenty ducats. He was accompanied to Constantinople by

sons Bartolo and Lorenzo, both of whom also were elected as appraisers through

their father’s intervention. Lorenzo was sent home to Venice in irons after com-

mitting several unspeciﬁed ‘‘errors,’’ probably fraud or theft, though he eventually

returned and regained his position in Constantinople, where he died in 1615.∞∂≠

"

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Despite their status as o≈cial appraisers for the Venetian nation, the Corniani

also aggressively sought work with Jewish and Muslim merchants, something

quite common among all Venice’s cernitori.∞∂∞

Many of the cernitori had worked in the cloth industry, in Venice or Con-

stantinople, for long periods— eighteen, twenty, even thirty years.∞∂≤ In applying

for a position, Giuseppe Sanzonio emphasized that he had ‘‘worked in wools and

hides all the time in my youth at [my] home, . . . and likewise in these lands.’’∞∂≥

Other supplicants emphasized their neediness: a Venetian cittadino, Marco Al-

briga, who worked in the wool industry came to Constantinople ‘‘because of

several misfortunes’’ but could not ﬁnd work. Cristoforo Mazzon from Brescia

was in debt and was elected when he threatened that, if not approved, he would

‘‘alienate myself from the service of the nation and merchants of Venice.’’∞∂∂

A similar situation was that of Niccolò Gonale, a subject from Venice, who may

originally have come from Candia. Initially he appeared in Constantinople trad-

ing with a Muslim merchant in 1592, and in 1594 he requested election as a

miserator ordinario of the nation and described his story. He had a wife and three

children, and ‘‘hoping more easily to ﬁnd a solution to my poverty, and to the

needs of these children, I decided to come to these lands with the litt le substance

that I had, and to set up a bottega of cloth, in which I worked for some time the

best I could, and because of the cruel famines that reigned, having left my wife

and children in Venice, I decided to have them come here [to Constantinople].’’∞∂∑

Gonale’s gambit in moving to Constantinople did not pan out. His a√airs ‘‘got

progressively worse’’; he fell into serious debt and was imprisoned for a time. He

requested election so as ‘‘to maintain my poor family as long as it pleases the Lord

God that I am able to remain free, so as to return to my patria with my family.’’

Additionally, Gonale argued for special consideration as a Venetian subject, as

‘‘many who are not subjects of Your Serenity’’ served the nation in these posi-

tions. Moved by his sorrowful tale, the council elected Gonale to the position of

cernitore by a unanimous vote.∞∂∏ The family never left Constantinople: Gonale

died in 1611, and his daughter married a Venetian subject from Brescia who

served in the household of several Venetian merchants in Galata.∞∂π

Gonale’s case raises the question of women and the Venetian nation. The

focus of this study has been predominant ly male, most ly because men made up

the majority of the Venetian expatriate community, but also because of the relative

archival silence regarding early modern women’s experiences, particularly on the

margins of the Mediterranean.∞∂∫ There are records regarding enough cases for a

picture of the women of the Venetian community, however anecdotal and incom-

plete, to emerge. In some instances women came to Constantinople for reasons

"
107,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

93

very similar to men— opportunity, slavery, absolution. For example, Fatima Ca-

dun, née Beatrice Michiel, came to Constantinople in late 1591 to join her brother,

the renegade eunuch Gazanfer A ˘ga, a trusted adviser within the sultan’s harem.

Her motives for ﬂeeing and renouncing her religion seem to have included ‘‘the

hope of deriving great gain, and maybe also from being litt le contented with her

husband,’’ who was intent on controlling assets from her ﬁrst marriage and

economic privileges the Signoria had granted her.∞∂Ω Another woman, Anzola

from Chioggia, came to Constantinople alone but then entered into a relationship

before the local kadı with Valerio Palmi, who worked as the embassy’s baker while

she nursed ill members of the nation and served as its washerwoman.∞∑≠ These

women, however, are exceptional. Although an occasional woman came alone to

Constantinople, the majority came in the company of men— fathers, husbands,

lovers— and their experiences, from what litt le we know, were strongly inﬂuenced

by the decisions and experiences of the men they accompanied.

While the great majority of banditi were men, there were some bandite, women

expelled from the Venetian state for a variety of crimes. Some were banished

alone for their indiscretions, such as the woman who injured a male notary;

Margarita of Tínos, exiled in 1615 for ‘‘carnal commerce’’; or the Cretan sisters

Elena and Regina, banished for an unspeciﬁed crime. In the case of Margarita,

after three years of banishment, the bailo granted her a safe-conduct in recogni-

tion of ‘‘the fragility of the female sex’’ and her ‘‘great poverty.’’∞∑∞

Venice’s paternalistic policy toward its men was even more pronounced to-

ward its female subjects. The Aristotelian and Christian view of women as ir-

rational and morally weaker than men still obtained, and thus the fear that a

woman would ‘‘lose her soul for being far from her patria’’ was strongly held.∞∑≤

The baili went to great lengths to remove women from Constantinople as quickly

as possible in order to distance them from the dangers of the city. This policy was

not uniquely Venetian; religious redeemers of slaves were instructed to ransom

ﬁrst women and children, who were ‘‘judged to be more exposed to the pressures

of the Muslims.’’ The French went so far as to forbid women from embarking for

the Levant, and a 1679 list grouped women with vagabonds and criminals as

equally undesirable elements in the Levant.∞∑≥ Although lacking an explicit policy,

the Signoria shared these attitudes: while the English and French ambassadors

often were accompanied by wives and children, the baili always left their families

in Venice.∞∑∂

The case of Donna Jacoma shows the ends to which Venetian political and

religious o≈cials would go to remove women from the corrupting inﬂuence of

Constantinople. How she ended up in Constantinople is unclear, but her extreme

"
108,"94

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

poverty and her desperate situation led a Venetian priest to fear she might be on

the verge of apostasy. To avoid this, he arranged a marriage with a young man of

twenty from Urbino, Simone de Bartolo, who had run into unspeciﬁed di≈culties

while doing business in Constantinople and made a solemn vow to marry whom-

ever his spiritual advisor proposed if his a√airs turned out in his favor. When this

occurred he agreed to wed Jacoma; she, however, ‘‘protested somewhat.’’ Threat-

ened by the priest ‘‘that if she did not accept this match . . . God would chastize

her, and that having fallen into such a miserable state she would be abhorred and

ostracized by everyone,’’ she ﬁnally was bullied into accepting the match.∞∑∑

As was the case with exiles, so too most Venetians enslaved in Constantinople

that we know about were men. Women do appear, however, and their numbers

may have been greater, but simply less likely to appear in o≈cial records because

their slavery often played out in Ottoman homes and other private realms. In one

case, funds from Proveditori sopra gli Hospitali and a special allocation of 150

ducats from the Senate provided a large ransom to free Laura Gritti and her

two young daughters, almost certainly from the noble Gritti family. A woman of

less exalted status, Donna Marietta Venetiana, who had a Jewish master, Abram

Calipin, was also manumitted with o≈cial funds, though in her case she was

constrained to work in the embassy to repay the money the bailo had spent to

free her.∞∑∏

Although some women were banished or enslaved alone, most often they

came in the company of a man. Some were banished as a couple, such as the

husband and wife expelled from Canea for their involvement in a murder there,

or Ludovico and Paolina Cagnola, banished from Padua. Most came by choice,

having elected to accompany husbands into exile. In some cases, banditi would

bring their entire families to Constantinople: Horatio di Marchi, banished from

Vicenza, came to Galata with his young wife and ‘‘four litt le children of tender

age.’’ To facilitate his return home, the bailo gave the young father a pardon

because he was a good ‘‘carpenter of artillery carriages, and also a cooper’’ but

especially because of his family, ‘‘all of whom in this land run the manifest risk to

be lost in an instant.’’∞∑π

In another case, an arsenal worker banished from Venice went initially to

Naples, where his banishment was rescinded on the onerous condition that he

not work in the shipping industry. Upset at this ruling and unable to provide for

his family, he brought his pregnant wife and two young children to Constan-

tinople intent on conversion and to ﬁnd work in the sultan’s shipyards. It seems

likely that this threat, backed up by the presence of wife and children, was in-

tended to elicit sympathy and the reversal of his banishment, which is exact ly

"
109,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

95

what occurred. More commonly, however, banished men used tales of the im-

poverishment of the families they left behind as a bargaining chip in obtaining a

safe-conduct.∞∑∫

Some women were brought from Venice by merchants to serve as maids or

cooks and not infrequent ly, as mistresses. In one instance, Francesco Spiera

brought a Madonna Betta Biscontina from Venice to work for him. When she

became pregnant, Spiera was ordered to pay the wages he had promised her, to

arrange for her return to Venice, to support her during her pregnancy at ﬁve

ducats per month, and to have his parents receive the child whom the bailo

ordered Betta to consign upon its birth.∞∑Ω

Madonna Betta’s case is quite unique, however, as most merchants’ partners

were not imported from Venice but rather were found among Constantinople’s

women. European merchant nations in general were made up most ly of bache-

lors, and while there were occasional exceptions, married merchants were almost

never accompanied by wives or children.∞∏≠ Occasionally a merchant might wed

a local woman, such as Giulio Croce, who married the noblewoman Cecilia Pisani

in the church of San Francesco. Pisani had been enslaved following Lepanto and

taken to Constantinople, where Croce paid 150,482 akçe to free her.∞∏∞ It was

also not uncommon for merchants to have female slaves—usually Greeks, Cir-

cassians, Russians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, but also an occasional Ethiopian—

whose duties included sexual services. The Venetian merchant Marcantonio

Stanga, for example, owned a slave and produced several children with her.∞∏≤

Much more common than Christian marriage, however, were temporary, rela-

tionships with Ottoman-Christian women which were formalized before local

Ottoman magistrates. George Sandys wrote of merchants in Constantinople

‘‘They live freely, and plentifully: and many of then wil not lye alone where

women are so easily come by. For besides the aforesaid markets [of slaves], it is a

use, not prohibited but onely by our religion, to purchase for their concubines the

beautifull daughters of the Grecians, . . . recording the contract in the Cadies

booke.’’∞∏≥

It was licit for foreigners to take a local spouse temporarily by presenting a

contract, or kâbin, before a kadı. These temporary marriages did not extend to

Muslim women, however, who were reserved solely to Ottoman men, at least in

theory.∞∏∂ Ma≈o Venier described these legal ceremonies: the kadı asked the

prospective husband what ﬁnancial sett lement or allowance (kâbin) he proposed

and, if acceptable to the woman, he took ‘‘the thumbs of both and touche[d] them

together from the inside out as a sign of the faith that they give.’’∞∏∑ Legally

recognized ‘‘contractual concubinage’’ relationships of this sort were common-

"
110,"96

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

place among merchants: the patriarchal vicar reported that ‘‘this is a thing in

which are involved the greater part of the merchants, both Venetians and French,

and also [those] from Pera.’’∞∏∏ Andrea Gritti fathered three sons with a Greek

woman during his long years in Constantinople, including the controversial Al-

vise Gritti. Indeed, one of the charges of opponents to Gritti’s election was that

‘‘one who has three bastard sons in Turkey should not be made doge.’’∞∏π While we

have no record of the baili keeping mistresses or entering into temporary mar-

riages, some of their famiglia did, and other European ambassadors openly lived

in such kâbin relationships: the French ambassador Brèves had three children

with a Greek women, whom he legitimized upon his subsequent marriage to a

French noblewoman.∞∏∫

As one man accused of adultery for maintaining a wife in Venice and a mis-

tress in Galata (a not uncommon phenomenon)∞∏Ω explained, merchants entered

into and justiﬁed these relationships ‘‘in the land of inﬁdels so as to not run the

risk of greater danger, as people are fragile, and inclined to sin.’’∞π≠ These legal

relationships with Christians helped prevent merchants from engaging in more

perilous intimacies with Muslim women. While in theory contact across gender

and religious lines was forbidden, in reality it was not unheard of.∞π∞ In 1604, a

Venetian merchant in Cyprus was caught in the house of a Muslim woman and

only narrowly escaped being burned.∞π≤ In 1596, Marcantonio Borisi, one of Ven-

ice’s most important dragomans, carried on an extended intimate relationship

with a Muslim neighbor whom he would sneak into his room in the embassy, at

great danger to himself and to Venice.∞π≥ When a band of four hundred French

soldiers, who had abandoned their post in Hungary and gone over to the sultan’s

service, arrived in Galata, they sequestered a number of Muslim women in their

private rooms.∞π∂ This behavior was not limited to soldiers and merchants: in

1609 an ecclesiastical authority inspecting the religious institutions of Galata

reported that ‘‘several of the monks of San Pietro had been immoderate with

some Turk women who neighbored their garden.’’∞π∑

Punishment for such relationships was often swift and harsh. One Venetian

merchant was hung for ‘‘having dared to cast his profane glance upon the beau-

ties of the harem,’’ with a spyglass pointed toward the seraglio. In another case,

a Christian boy was quartered, and his Muslim lover dragged nude behind a

horse.∞π∏ Most relationships, however, seem not to have ended so badly. As the

always observant Fynes Moryson reported, the reality of Christian-Muslim inti-

macies was less straightforward than the laws and occasional expiatory execution

suggested: ‘‘If a Christian man committ fornication with a Turke woman both are

"
111,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

97

putt to death, and this Common danger to both, makes them more wary of others,

and more conﬁdent to trust one an other, but the sinne is Common, and at

Constantinople the houses of the Ambassadors being free from the search of

magistrates very Turkes, yea the Janizaries guarding the persons and howses of

these Ambassadors, will not stick to play the bawdes for a small reward.’’∞ππ

As Moryson makes clear, Ottoman o≈cials were not always energetic in en-

forcing the letter of the law; they even might collude in circumventing it. This

is supported by another case, involving the Venetian merchant Zuanantonio Nor-

dio, who was caught with a Muslim woman in his house. As the bailo reported,

‘‘This is the greatest crime, which is punished with impalement of both parties

without trial, and with the loss of all merchandise. Nonetheless, everything was

quickly resolved and assuaged with 300 ducats paid by him before the incident

reached the ear of the pa¸sa or some other important minister, who the bigger they

are take bigger bribes.’’∞π∫

The baili roundly condemned these sorts of dangerous liaisons, less on moral

grounds than on the intractable economic and political problems that arose if a

merchant died in Ottoman lands and left behind children from these kâbin mar-

riages. While considered bastards in Christianity, children from such relation-

ships were recognized by Islamic law, which did not recognize illegitimacy, and

extensive negotiations frequent ly ensued over the ﬁnancial obligations owed the

children and their mothers.∞πΩ Giorgio Giustinian clearly delineated the risks of

such immorality among merchants: ‘‘The lack of control and the extreme sen-

suality of some of our merchants can cause their principals grave damage, and the

baili of Your Lordship many travails, because these women . . . arrive unexpect-

edly to declare themselves haracgüzar of the Grand Lord and to place the mer-

chandise in manifest peril.’’∞∫≠ Despite oft-repeated injunctions, however, mer-

chants and others continued to enter into these relationships.

As the numerous cases above suggest, there was a close relationship between

the o≈cial nation and the broader community that existed on its periphery. Clearly

these uno≈cial individuals saw themselves as, and were considered, part of the

larger Venetian community. One way the nation a≈rmed and strengthened this

bond was by supplying opportunities for Venetians and subjects to work in asso-

ciation with the nation, if not to trade o≈cially under its auspices. A paternalistic

impulse among the baili and merchants helped provide for the needs of the

impoverished in the community and to protect them from the perceived dangers

of life in Constantinople. This was particularly true in the case of women and

children. While o≈cially the presence of unsanctioned individuals was discour-

"
112,"98

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

aged, in practice the nation’s merchants and diplomats needed many of the ser-

vices that such men and women could provide, and thus they e√ectively facilitated

their continuing presence by providing them jobs and support.

s a i l o r s , t r a v e l e r s , a n d o th e r t r a n s i t o r y p e o p l e

The Venetian community in Constantinople included both stable and more

transitory elements: among these latter were the many travelers from Venice and

its territories who made the pilgrimage to the Porte, and the crews of the ships

that regularly anchored in the port of Galata. It is di≈cult to establish accurately

the number of such travelers passing through at any given time. One visitor in

1581 estimated that there were ﬁve to six hundred transient residents in Ga-

lata alone; a seventeenth-century churchman estimated some one hundred trav-

elers in Constantinople.∞∫∞ Published reports on the splendors of the city created

among Christians what one Englishman called ‘‘an itching desire to see . . .

Constantinople . . . the seate of the Turkish Ottoman.’’ Similarly, Sir Henry Blount

declared in 1635, ‘‘He who would better behold these Times in their greatest glory

could not ﬁnd a better scene than Turkey.’’∞∫≤

Because of Venice’s historic link with the Ottoman Empire, Venetians were

regular and enthusiastic travelers to Constantinople. One such traveler wrote

that the city was ‘‘set in the most beautiful and charming site that man can

imagine.’’ Another enthused upon his departure, ‘‘I still cannot calm my soul nor

my eyes, . . . having ﬁxed [in them] the graciousness of Constantinople, nor can I

wait to have the occasion to return and enjoy it; I feel I have died and gone to

heaven.’’∞∫≥ Venetians were among the most proliﬁc writers of travel accounts on

the region: of 449 travel reports written in this period, fully 20 percent were com-

posed by Venetians. As one scholar has written, ‘‘among the voyages most noted

and dear to the Venetians, . . . Constantinople undoubtedly held ﬁrst place, . . .

There was not a man of politics or of business that had not removed himself at

least once to the shores of the Bosporus, and very few had withstood the desire—

when there was not a political duty— to note down, often for publication, the

experiences of this voyage.’’∞∫∂

When Venetian diplomats traveled to Constantinople to take up o≈ce, they

were invariably accompanied by fellow patricians. Pietro Foscarini was joined by

several Venetians, including his two sons, who were inspired to travel to the

Ottoman Empire by a virtuosa curiosità.∞∫∑ Jacopo Soranzo reported that when

word of his 1582 embassy became public, ‘‘an inﬁnite number of gent lemen

scrambled with warm requests . . . to be admitted to the number of those that

"
113,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

99

would accompany and serve your most Illustrious Serenity on this voyage, con-

sidering the noble and rare occasion to see the Porte, the security and comfort of

the trip, the information that one could acquire about many things, and that

which is most important, to insinuate themselves in the grace of that Lord.’’∞∫∏

A visit to the Porte was requisite preparation for a patrician’s future career in

state service. After completing his studies, Agostino Gussoni resided in Con-

stantinople for over a year, studying Ottoman government so that ‘‘by seeing the

world [he might] make himself more expert in these matters.’’∞∫π Tommaso Priuli

came to Constantinople after having been to all the major European courts,

saving the most important for last, after which, ‘‘according to custom . . . he would

begin to dedicate himself to the most important o≈ces.’’∞∫∫ Patricians also trav-

eled to the Ottoman capital temporarily to resolve personal and familial matters.

Andrea Soranzo and Marchio Zane, for example, accompanied Marco Venier on

his voyage to Constantinople. Soranzo was involved in a number of commercial

dealings there, and Zane came ‘‘with the desire to see the greatness of this grand

Porte, and also to assist in some skillful way the pretensions of the brother-in-law

of his brother, Signor Zuanne, in his request for the principality of Wallachia.’’∞∫Ω

Galata was also regularly ﬁlled with crew members from the many merchant

ships docked in its port. Although by 1600 Venetian maritime commerce had

certainly declined in absolute terms (in many cases replaced by overland caravans

passing through Split), ships of Venetian registry still came to Constantinople

every year. Some were large merchant craft that sailed the waters between Venice

and Constantinople, stopping at many of the islands of the stato da mar. More

numerous were the many smaller boats of Greek-Venetian subjects that plied the

route between Candia, Tínos, Zante, and other islands.∞Ω≠ By the sixteenth cen-

tury the medieval galley had been replaced by larger round ships of 600– 700

tons, such as the carrack. These ships employed between ﬁfty and eighty crew

members— oarsmen, masters, seamen, deck hands, and a noble ‘‘bowman of the

quarterdeck.’’ Though Venetians occasionally served on these ships, the majority

of the crews were drawn from the stato da mar, the terraferma, and increasingly

from outside Venetian dominions.∞Ω∞

When a ship dropped anchor in the port of Galata then, there was a signiﬁcant,

if temporary, inﬂux of men into the Venetian community, with an attendant

transformation of its makeup. While in port, these men, whether Venetian sub-

jects or not, were the responsibility and under the jurisdiction of the baili, and

numerous court cases in the chancellery’s records attest to the frequent problems

the mariners caused. In one case, a ship’s cook was charged with insubordination

and blasphemy after a dustup with a shipmate over a woman. Another time, two

"
114,"100

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Greek-Venetian sailors fought a duel over a debt. The ﬁrst man to ﬁre killed his

opponent with a direct shot to the heart, and the surviving duelist was condemned

to ﬁve years on a prison galley.∞Ω≤ One of the reasons for these recurring problems,

was that Venetian ships generally remained in port for up to four months, much

longer than the typical one month stay of English and Dutch ships. In part,

Venetian ships remained longer because crews were permitted to carry a certain

amount of merchandise to trade on their own— this had long been Venetian

practice, and change was slow in coming.∞Ω≥

In the case of ships’ crews, the men’s necessarily extended stays in the city

made Venice’s paternal policy of trying to keep its charges out of Constantinople’s

libertine atmosphere clearly untenable. The baili did try to limit the number of

young men who came to the capital. In 1580 Giovanni Cappello reported that

numerous young men serving as mocci, or ship’s boys, upon arriving in Con-

stantinople regularly abandoned their ships, their families, and their faith, ‘‘led

astray by those already involved’’ in licentious practices. He proposed that the

Senate forbid youths under age eighteen to serve in any capacity on ships that

would bring them to Constantinople.∞Ω∂ Venetian patricians were particularly

concerned about the danger that youth of their caste encountered while serving

as ship’s nobles. The practice of sending young nobles on Venetian ships as

balestrieri di popa or nobeli di galia had a long history as a sort of apprenticeship

for aspiring young merchants. As merchants retreated from international com-

merce, these positions became a popular form of state welfare to subsidize the

impoverished majority of the patriciate. A young noble received free passage,

food, a salary of approximately sixty ducats, and the right to carry merchandise

that could be traded at a good proﬁt.∞Ω∑ While potentially a signiﬁcant subsidy for a

poor patrician family, there were still concerns about this policy in the dangerous

Mediterranean world. As Gianfrancesco Morosini reported in 1583, sending no-

bles to learn the ‘‘art of navigation’’ was a good idea,

But doing it as it is now done is surely damning, and of manifest peril, because

youths of fourteen or ﬁfteen years are sent to learn every other thing than the art of

navigation and once they arrive here we run the manifest peril that they be stolen by

Turks with the loss of their souls . . . Your Serenity would be more secure if you

commanded that in these parts nobles under the age of twenty years did not come on

your ships, so that at least we could be more at peace from the danger that they might

be stolen, as I have already experienced with one boy who is here in my house with

me . . . [Fathers who] think they are providing for their children [will have] to give

account to the Lord God for the education that they will have given them.∞Ω∏

"
115,"t h e u n o f f i c i a l n a t i o n

101

‘‘Stolen,’’ of course, could mean being captured and enslaved involuntarily, as in

the case of Francesco Pisani, nobile of the Colomba. It could also refer to voluntary

conversions, such as the ship’s noble from ‘‘Ca’ Lombardo’’ who under ‘‘his own

pure and spontaneous impulse, turned Turk.’’∞Ωπ Conversion was not the only

danger facing these young nobles: in 1601 a ship’s noble, Niccolo Zane, ‘‘a minor

child,’’ gambled with the older men on his ship (which was against the law) and

lost his money and merchandise.∞Ω∫

If youths provoked the baili’s paternal concern, mature crew members in the

end created many more problems through their contraband, violence, and con-

ﬂicts with local authorities. In 1612 there was a row between sailors and janis-

saries, in which some of the latter were badly wounded, which cost a bribe of a

crimson vest and ninety ducats to resolve.∞ΩΩ These sorts of incidents created

unwanted expenses for the baili, and also potentially serious political complica-

tions. In 1638, for example, several sailors from the Nave Nuova fought among

themselves and two were gravely wounded, as was an Ottoman customs o≈cial.

‘‘At the uproar the Bostancıba¸sı came in person, and he took the Barber and

another sailor to the Seraglio’s prison, not so much as promoters of the trouble as

the wounders of a Turk in the hand.’’ Alvise Contarini tried to secure the men’s

release, arguing that the Capitulations gave the bailo the right to punish Vene-

tians. The Ottoman o≈cial, who wanted to cut o√ the men’s hands, responded

that this was true only ‘‘when they came to blows among themselves as sailors on

Venetian ships, but when these same sailors railed against Turks, this was clearly

not covered by the Capitulations.’’ Contarini ﬁnally obtained their release through

his good o≈ces, but similar incidents were all too common.≤≠≠

Another problem was sailors jumping ship. Because of the demand for quali-

ﬁed seamen in Venice and Constantinople, there was competition for their ser-

vices. Some ships’ o≈cers paid to release debtors from prison in return for their

services. Thus, Venetian crewmen regularly abandoned their posts while in port,

leaving their ships shorthanded. Such an act might result from mistreatment by

the ship’s o≈cers, or because better wages or a pay advance could be obtained

from another captain, either Christian or Muslim. Some men also jumped ship

and converted to Islam.≤≠∞ Such experiences rea≈rmed for the Signoria the wis-

dom of its policy to keep unsanctioned people out of Constantinople and out of

harm’s way as much as possible.

The deﬁnition of Venetian and the composition of the Venetian community in

Constantinople was much more diverse than its merchant and diplomatic core

might indicate. Venetian law and tradition had a very narrow deﬁnition of what

"
116,"102

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

constituted the Venetian nation. In practice, however, the Venetian community

was much broader and more ﬂuid than just its two o≈cial elements, merchants

and diplomats. Individuals from a wide range of cultural, social, economic, and

linguistic backgrounds considered, perhaps imagined, themselves to be part of

the larger community. Men and women from the Greek islands of the stato da

mar, individuals and families banished from Venetian lands, sailors, soldiers,

slaves, and travelers all came to Constantinople. While there they became de facto

part of the nation, at least peripherally. Not only did these individuals imagine

themselves as part of the nation, but the o≈cial nation also considered them to be

part of the larger Venetian community, if on a di√erent footing than the diplomats

and merchants. The o≈cial policy of the baili and the Venetian government was

to discourage the presence of these groups in Constantinople for a variety of

political, economic, and moral reasons, but in practice they went to signiﬁcant

lengths that facilitated the long-term residency of these people and asserted and

protected their rights as Venetian subjects.

Jews, Renegades, and

Early Modern Identity

With the burgeoning travel literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-

turies, accounts such as Pietro della Valle’s description of his voyage to Con-

stantinople in 1614 became increasingly common.∞ Julien Bordier, squire of the

French ambassador to Constantinople Jean Gontaut, baron of Salignac, produced

a similar narrative of his travels into the ‘‘Orient’’ in the ﬁrst years of the seven-

teenth century. Housed in the Bibliothèque Nationale is a manuscript of this

intrepid traveler’s ‘‘Relation d’un voyage en Orient,’’ the ﬁfth book of which

contains an account of Bordier’s travels to the Black Sea entrepôt of Trebizond

(modern day Trabzon) in 1609. As was typical of travel accounts of this era,

Bordier devotes considerable space to a careful description of the historical and

religious attractions of the city. In addition, he records his encounters with the

region’s populations: these include ‘‘all sorts of diverse nations, both from Persia,

Armenia, Georgia, Mangrelia, Cherhasia, Tartaria, Syria and from many other

nations.’’ He also described meeting ‘‘not only Georgians, Greeks and other

Christian nations of the Levant, but also Muhammadans.’’≤ Bordier’s account

conveys the multicultural complexity of the early modern Mediterranean and

provides a window onto the way he described and ordered the diverse world he

encountered during his travels. As was the case with della Valle, Bordier’s taxon-

omy comprised two chief categories, religion and nation.

While nation and religion were among the primary categories early modern

people employed both to order their world and to deﬁne themselves, they also

recognized the variable and composite character of identity. In the mid-sixteenth

century, the imperial ambassador Busbecq wrote of encountering a man who was

"
124,"104

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

‘‘an Italian Greek, i.e., both in birth and manners half Greek and half Italian.’’

Sandys referred to ‘‘the Greeke Genoeses in Pera,’’ whom he distinguished from

the ‘‘normal’’ Greeks, as well as ‘‘European Turks,’’ and a Jesuit described a drago-

man as a ‘‘Greek-Turk.’’ Fynes Moryson described sailors as Greek ‘‘though sub-

ject to the State of Venice.’’≥ Similarly, the English organ builder Thomas Dallam

reported meeting two men: one ‘‘was a Turke, but a Cornishe man borne,’’ the

other, ‘‘an Inglishe man, borne in Chorlaye in Lancashier; his name Finche. He

was in religion a perﬁt Turk, but he was our trustie frende.’’ A man described as a

‘‘Florentine Turk’’ gave two lamps to decorate the church of San Francesco in

1622, and a French consul reported meeting a Suleyman Aga, whom he described

as ‘‘of the French nation [ français de nation], and a Turk of some consideration.’’∂

The pilgrim Arnold von Har√ wrote of ﬁnding in Cairo ‘‘two German Mame-

lukes, one born in Basel, . . . The other was born in Denmark.’’ Busbecq reported

a friendship he struck up with an Ali Pa ¸sa, ‘‘by birth a Dalmatian, he is a thorough

gent leman, and has (what you will be surprised to hear of in a Turk) a kind and

feeling heart.’’ Finally, an English traveler recorded his encounter in Ragusa with

‘‘Mr. Wyllyam Robynsoun, ane Inglyshe man, a man of many words but slo in

performing, for tyme hathe so allterred the man that he ys becom a Slavonyan

in natur.’’∑

In the Ottoman context, Stéphane Yérasimos has shown that in Ottoman

documents there was signiﬁcant ‘‘inter-penetration’’ and interchangeability in

use of ethnic and religious categories.∏ By combining ‘‘national’’ and religious

categories, these early modern observers suggest both the composite, ‘‘horizon-

tal’’ character of identity, as well as its malleable nature, in the same way that we in

the modern age evoke the multiple layers of self through hyphenated identities—

African-American, Italian-American, Jewish-American.π

The temptation in confronting the multiple elements of identity evident in

these descriptions is to try to order them, to categorize them, to create a hierarchy

or taxonomy of identity that ranks its various elements according to importance.

In the inﬁnite variety of the past, historians are trained to try to make order where

disorder exists. In the case of identity, we must be very careful in doing this. When

attempts are made to reduce identity to its essence or even to its various con-

stituent parts, we run the risk of making ﬁxed and concrete what was really a ﬂuid

and protean process rather than an apprehendable object; identity in the early

modern era was ‘‘a bundle of shifting interactions’’ and a step along ‘‘a con-

tinuum.’’∫ Early modern identities were not deﬁned by some essence or ‘‘pri-

mordial quality.’’ They did not necessarily depend on political boundaries, lin-

guistic, religious, or cultural factors though all of these could and often did come

"
125,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

105

into play. Rather, early modern identity was a process of deﬁnition and redeﬁni-

tion, of imagining communities, of perceiving or creating boundaries, as well as

challenging these boundaries. It was, as it is today, ‘‘contingent and relational.’’Ω

The simplicity and clarity of objectifying identity, of reducing it to some foun-

dational characteristics that deﬁne the essence of being French or Venetian, Mus-

lim or Christian, male or female, Ottoman or European, or any combination of

the above can be very seductive, however. Cemal Kafadar has described this as the

‘‘lid model,’’ which assumes the ‘‘more or less sealed cultural identities of peoples

(Turks, Greeks, Spaniards, Arabs) who have come into contact within the frame-

work of a larger bipolar division of equally sealed civilizational identities (East /

West, Muslim /Christian, etc.).’’∞≠ Studying individual and group identities as

process rather than object, as ﬂuid rather than ﬁxed, reveals a picture that, while

often contradictory and ambiguous, nonetheless gives us a much more histori-

cally sensitive and accurate image of the premodern, prenational world. Building

on the previous chapters’ deconstruction of the Venetian nation, the next two

chapters address the question of early modern identity more direct ly, in the con-

text of individuals and groups who existed within or on the periphery of the

Venetian nation in Constantinople and who both navigated and embodied the

composite and dynamic nature of identities in the early modern Mediterranean.

j e w s

When considering groups who moved between the various cultural and politi-

cal poles of the Mediterranean, perhaps the most familiar case is that of the Jews.

The label Jew, of course, masks a much more complex religious and cultural

identity. Recent research has emphasized the diversity, and even antagonism, that

existed within the broad community of Jews. For example, the Ottoman city

Thessaloníki was known as the ‘‘the Jerusalem of the Balkans’’ because of its high

concentration of Jews, yet it was not a homogenous or a united community.

Rather, the Jews of Thessaloníki represented ‘‘a conglomeration of diverse, inde-

pendent groups, often at odds with one another.’’ Each congregation bore the

name of its provenance, spoke its own language, had its own rabbi, and generally

lived in a common section of the city. Indeed, each congregation ‘‘was like a city

unto itself, . . . Each congregation zealously guarded its identity.’’∞∞ In Venice, a

similar situation existed within the università degli Ebrei, a collective term used by

Christians and Jews that masked a very diverse, even divided, community of Jews,

who separated themselves into three nations—German (which included Italian-

born Jews), Levantine, and Ponentine.∞≤ The homogeneity of these ‘‘national,’’

"
126,"106

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

regional, and cultural subgroups of Jews should not be exaggerated, however.

There is ample evidence of the porosity of their communal boundaries and of

migration between them, and of the constant ly evolving, negotiated process of

communal deﬁnition and redeﬁnition.∞≥

In the early modern era, one of the most compelling Jewish communities, and

also the most elusive in terms of identity, was that of the conversos, Iberian-

Jewish converts to Christianity, more commonly known as Marranos.∞∂ Chris-

tians had a great deal of di≈culty categorizing Marranos: one observer com-

plained, ‘‘these Marranos are worse than the Jews since they are not Christians

nor are they Jews.’’ In 1550 when the Senate forbade trade with Marranos, Chris-

tian merchants on the Rialto were upset because of the di≈culty in deciding ‘‘who

is a Marrano and who not.’’ The problem was ‘‘we know neither the background

nor the way of life of these men, nor what they believe or what they do not.’’∞∑ To

further complicate matters, in Venice ‘‘Marrano’’ came to indicate almost any

Spaniard or Portuguese regardless of religion, and in the Ottoman Empire ‘‘Span-

ish’’ generally signiﬁed Jewish until the twentieth century.∞∏

This di≈culty in precisely categorizing the Marranos was not uncommon,

even for other Jews, as the case of Righetto, alias Anriquez Nuñez, alias Abraham

Benvenisti, reveals. An Italian, a Portuguese, and a Jewish name ‘‘concealed three

di√erent social identities, which Righetto manipulated as . . . the occasion called

for.’’ Though at one point he insisted that his essential self was Jewish, his self-

constructions and reconstructions indicate a much more ﬂuid identity.∞π One

leader of the Jewish community in Venice charged Righetto, a Marrano, as being

‘‘ ‘a ship with two rudders,’ a man willing to trim his sails to the prevailing

religious and political winds . . . because he is neither Jew nor Christian.’’ This

indeterminancy seems to have been a family trait: it was said of Righetto’s father,

‘‘he is neither Christian nor Jew nor Turk, and could not himself tell you what law

he follows, save that of making money.’’∞∫

This chameleon-like ambiguity— religious, to be sure, but also political and

social—was not unique; the records contain many references to Jewish merchants

as members of a class ‘‘which knows no frontiers.’’∞Ω One of the most famous

examples is that of the man described in the chapter tit le of a popular history of

the Venetian ghetto as ‘‘João Miches, Giovanni Miguez, Joseph Nasi, Duke of

Naxos: Four Names and Many Diverse Identities for One Man.’’≤≠ A study of

rabbinical responsa literature for this period reveals that religious leaders per-

ceived the number of Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam as a signiﬁ-

cant problem. These documents also suggest motives for Jewish conversion,

including as a means ‘‘to escape from a di≈cult situation, to spite an enemy or to

"
127,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

107

attain a selﬁsh ambition.’’ Conversion was also a quick way to resolve marital

problems: ‘‘In one instance, it was a man’s desire to marry another man’s wife, for

by embracing the Moslem faith, he obtained the aid of its religious authorities. In

another case, it was the man’s eagerness to rid himself of his wife.’’ Women who

converted to free themselves of undesirable husbands were also not uncom-

mon.≤∞ In Venice there are also numerous instances of Jews who were baptized as

Christians; the Senate even provided housing and religious instruction to these

Christian neophytes at the Casa dei Catecumeni. At times, Venice also provided

male converts with positions as commercial brokers ‘‘so that [they] may have the

means to sustain [themselves] and continue in the most holy Catholic faith.’’≤≤

Even the great Jewish Messianic mystic Shabbatai Sevi (1626– 76), when captured

and given the choice between death or conversion, chose the latter and assumed

the name Aziz Mehmed Efendi and received a royal pension and an honorary

position in the sultan’s household. During the remainder of his life he attracted

‘‘some two hundred Jewish families’’ to Islam, though he and they continued to

observe some Jewish traditions.≤≥

As these cases suggest, both Jews and Christians looked upon the Marranos

with suspicion because of their functional identity and the seeming ease with

which they transgressed traditional social and cultural boundaries. As one scholar

has observed, ‘‘Jews in Italy were inclined to see Portuguese Marranos as pre-

varicators, and were hostile to them on the grounds that in religion they were half-

breeds or hermaphrodites, neither Christian ﬁsh nor Jewish fowl.’’ One convert to

Christianity similarly commented, ‘‘The way of these Portuguese is that they go to

Ferrara and have themselves circumcised, and then they come to Venice and

depart for the Levant where they stay for three or four years, and then they return

to Venice with Levantine turbans upon their heads . . . Portuguese of this type are

neither Christians nor Jews nor Turks nor Moors . . . They are hated by the other

Jews because they bear nothing but the headgear of Jews.’’≤∂ Altering identity was

often as simple as changing clothes: when Righetto saw important Venetian

o≈cials on the street, he put on the yellow hat all Jews were required to wear, ‘‘and

when he passed them he took it o√ and put it under his arm and placed on his

head another hat or cap which was black.’’ Indeed, it was not uncommon for

residents of Venice’s ghetto to obtain exemptions permitting them to remove the

yellow caps that marked them as Jews.≤∑

Righetto was ﬁnally tried before the Inquisition for his overly and overt ly

malleable identity. In his own defense, he argued that it was legitimate to assume

‘‘a Christian identity from motives of self-preservation, as and where appropri-

ate . . . [and that] Christianity had never been to him more than a protective

"
128,"108

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

skin.’’≤∏ He was convicted and imprisoned, but he soon escaped to Constanti-

nople, where he lived openly as a Jew and was active in the Duke of Naxos’s circle.

Righetto’s permutations were not done, however, as he eventually returned to his

native Spain and reconciled with Catholicism because he ‘‘had felt himself dis-

tanced from the ‘Lei de Moises’ ’’ during his Constantinople sojourn. He acknowl-

edged having observed Jewish law and practices ‘‘but only because he did not have

the grace of God, and, since being in prison in Portugal, he had practised none of

the Jewish rites, which he had even begun to detest.’’≤π Righetto’s is a fascinating

case of a man whose public and private religious, social, and political selves were

constant ly in ﬂux; who he really was is in many ways immaterial.

The malleability of the Marranos, and other Jews, was both beneﬁcial and

troubling to Venice and other European powers. The beneﬁt they provided was

clear, whatever religious misgivings they may have raised, as beginning in the

sixteenth century the Jews became an important, perhaps even dominant, part of

Venice’s commercial fabric. Jews had been forbidden to participate in the Levan-

tine trade in the Middle Ages, but by the sixteenth century the evolving commer-

cial situation led the rulers of Venice and other Italian cities to compete for

important Jewish merchants, granting them special charters and commercial

privileges usually reserved for patricians and citizens. Indeed, English, Dutch,

and Flemish merchants in Venice sought similar special privileges but were never

granted them.≤∫ The combination of religious pogroms in parts of Europe and the

relative religious tolerance of Islam made Ottoman lands another magnet for

displaced Jews from across Europe, and very quickly they came to occupy an

important position in the Levantine trade.≤Ω

Some scholars have argued that by 1600 the Jews were the largest player in

Venice’s Levantine trade, occupying perhaps even a hegemonic position, though

this has been more often asserted than demonstrated.≥≠ Passing observations of

travelers and the ferocious complaints of Venetian o≈cials suggest that the Jews

were making important inroads, but as some scholars have argued, this picture is

based on anecdotal sources often inclined to exaggeration. A truly statistical pic-

ture, based on hard data, of the relative and absolute strength of the Jewish

position is still lacking.≥∞ Still, we do have some numbers: in 1625 the V Savii esti-

mated that Jewish business interests drew 100,000 ducats annually to Venetian

co√ers, and in Ragusa Jews represented 60 percent of the brokers and brought in

large quantities of goods.≥≤ There is no question that in the early modern era Jews

became an important and inﬂuential trading bloc within the Venetian and Medi-

terranean economies. Merchants traded through them in Constantinople to avoid

certain customs and other duties, and it was widely believed that patricians prof-

"
129,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

109

ited in Venice by allowing Jews to trade under their names. During times of war,

Venetian merchants regularly traded through Jewish merchants who were able to

remain active.≥≥

Relations between Venice and its Jewish communities were characterized by

commercial and political expediency, cooperation, and indulgence, but there also

could be hostility, anger, and fear. Jews feared the arbitrariness of Venice’s control

over them, a concern founded in several sixteenth-century expulsions. Venice was

anxious about both the takeover of commerce by the Jews and their polluting

inﬂuence within the Christian social fabric of the city.≥∂ Jews were perceived as

wanting all the beneﬁts with none of the costs of being Venetians; the baili

complained repeatedly that the Jews ‘‘want all the comforts that the subjects of

Your Serenity enjoy, and also to withdraw all the trade of our city to themselves,

and then they do not want to pay even a minimal thing.’’≥∑ Perception of the Jews

as having very malleable identities made them, and especially the Marranos,

appear a greater threat than other groups. Venice was relatively tolerant of re-

ligious heterogeneity, even among Protestants, as long as it could be classiﬁed

and therefore controlled.≥∏ Marranos, and to an extent Jews in general, could

not be pinned down easily, either by their own or by Christian o≈cials, and

the assumption that they had ‘‘neither Patria nor Prince’’ contributed to their

liminal status.≥π

Part of the problem for Christians in this uneasy marriage was the ambiguous

and often transitory relationship of Jews to the polities in which they resided.

During the Middle Ages, some Jews, the so-called white-Venetians, had traded

alongside patrician merchants in Constantinople, and some had received a form

of citizenship. In the early modern period, however, while many Christian immi-

grants obtained Venetian citizenship by residing in the city a certain amount of

time and paying taxes, Jews could not become citizens no matter how long they

stayed in the city or how much income they brought into its co√ers.≥∫ In the

Ottoman capital, there were many Jewish merchants who either were born or had

resided in Venice for some period of time and many who had family members in

Venice’s ghetto. Despite their privileged commercial status in Venice, these Jews

were never considered part of the o≈cial Venetian nation in Constantinople.

Indeed, it was never quite clear what their relationship to the nation was, and

many traded as often as Ottoman subjects as they did as Venetian. Jews never

appear listed among the merchants’ governing councils, and the records of the

embassy are rife with complaints about the unwillingness of Jewish merchants

with Venetian ties to pay their required duties. This situation became so bad in the

early seventeenth century that Bailo Simone Contarini turned to the sultan to

"
130,"110

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

order his own customs o≈cials to collect duties from Jews because Venetian

o≈cials were unable to do so.≥Ω

This does not mean that Jews were not considered in some limited ways as

members of the broader Venetian nation. Occasionally, an individual was distin-

guished as a ‘‘Venetian Jew’’ in the bailo’s notarial protocols.∂≠ Jews also periodi-

cally occupied o≈cial positions, such as consuls or dragomans in remote locales,

while others possessed plum jobs among the nation’s brokers.∂∞ Jews interacted

regularly with the o≈cial and uno≈cial elements of the nation; they often regis-

tered transactions and other legal a√airs before the nation’s notaries; and in some

instances they submitted to the legal judgments of the baili.∂≤ This should not be

overstated, however, as in the end Jews generally were considered part of their

own nation rather than subjects of Venice or the Ottoman Empire. This Jewish

nation was perceived primarily in religious terms, though Venetians had a clear

sense of the cultural and regional diversity masked by the label Jew.∂≥

Venice generally maintained a comparatively favorable policy toward Jews,

despite the ambiguity of their position.∂∂ Beginning in the sixteenth century, Jews

in Venice were collectively granted charters allowing them to reside in the city,

which gave them certain special privileges, though their juridical relationship to

the Venetian state remained decidedly murky. There was some sense of the Jews

in Constantinople existing on the periphery of the Venetian community as sub-

jects of Venice, at least in the opinion of the nation, and perhaps also of the

Jews themselves. One bailo intervened in the Porte on behalf of Gallata Valenzin,

a ‘‘Jewish-Venetian subject [ebreo suddito Veneto],’’ who had died in Galata and

whose goods had subsequent ly been conﬁscated and whose nephew and heir,

‘‘Jesurun Venetiano,’’ had been imprisoned. In this case, both the sultan and the

bailo concurred that Valenzin and his nephew while Jewish were nonetheless also

Venetian subjects, and as a result the merchandise and the boy were ordered

turned over to the bailo as the capitulations prescribed for all Venetian subjects

who died in the Ottoman Empire.∂∑ Salomon Ashkenazi, who played a key role

during the War of the Holy League, was described as a ‘‘subject of Your Serenity

[suddito di Vostra Serenità].’’ Ashkenazi was exceptional, though, as he had been

born in Udine and studied in Padua before going to Constantinople, and his role

in the crisis of the early 1570s earned him special recognition and privileges from

the Senate.∂∏ In contrast to the seemingly exceptional loyalty of Ashkenazi, Gian-

francesco Morosini reported that the Levantine Jews in Venice were disloyal and

communicated sensitive information to Jews in Constantinople; this attitude was

shared by many other patricians.∂π Most Jews, and especially Marranos, were

immigrants and of litt le individual importance to Venice. Rather, their signiﬁ-

"
131,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

111

cance was collective in nature. And collectively, Jews were guests in the city,

granted certain favorable rights but maintained at a distance and only on the good

will of the patrician rulers of Venice, who could and did revoke these rights.

The ambiguity of the Jewish position is evident in the case of David Passi, a

Marrano. Passi was a commercial agent in Ragusa; his wife lived in Ferrara, his

father in Thessaloníki; his uncle was a doctor in Constantinople. Situated in the

interstices of the major Mediterranean powers of the day, where did his loyalties

lie? He was a double agent for Spain and Venice in the 1570s and provided

information to the sultans from his network of agents in all major European

courts. Despite this political ambiguity, in 1584 he wrote the Senate from Con-

stantinople, where he was an intimate in the divan, asking for its intervention in a

matter involving another Marrano. Passi invoked his Venetian identity, pointing

to his eighteen years residence in the ghetto, his service to Venice, and his wife

and children, ‘‘who are also subjects of that most excellent Republic and were

born under its wings.’’∂∫

Passi was not exceptional; it was not uncommon for Jews to move between

Venice and Constantinople and other regions, claiming subject status in one

or the other and using it to obtain immunity from local prosecution and per-

secution.∂Ω In 1600 in reaction to the economic and political troubles plaguing

Constantinople, and the targeting of their community for reprisals, many Jews

considered migrating, or re-migrating, to Venice. There was a constant fear of

retaliation for the role of Joseph Nasi in the previous war, but these Jews also

recognized their importance to both Venice and the Ottoman Empire. One family,

the Abudenti, already had representatives in the lagoon and negotiated the terms

of their transfer. They would consider migrating only if granted several guaran-

tees: a house in the ghetto with the rent paid, freedom from the Inquisition, a

safe-conduct for ten years, and three years time to get out of Venice should the

Jews be expelled. The Senate acceded to these demands, justifying its policies

toward families such as the Abudenti not in religious terms but as political expe-

dients to prevent the strengthening of an enemy.∑≠ In another instance, a Marrano

merchant who had left Portugal for Venice moved to Constantinople where he

became a haracgüzar. Several years later, he and his family decided to return to

Venice, and despite what might have been perceived as their betrayal, the bailo

recommended to the Senate that they be allowed to return.∑∞

Other examples also suggest the ambiguity of the Jews’ status: when Jewish

merchants in Pesaro, subject to the Papacy, encountered problems with Maltese

corsairs, they wrote to the Duke of Naxos in Constantinople, asking for the assis-

tance of the Ottoman ﬂeet. When Esperanza, the famed Jewish intimate (or kira)

"
132,"112

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

of the queen mother Saﬁye, heard about problems the Jews in Venice were en-

countering, she chastised them for not allowing her to intervene: ‘‘Inform me and

I will not fail to help you with all my spirit and diligence, as I must and as I am

able.’’∑≤ Even after the main branch of the Abudenti family relocated to Venice,

Ottoman o≈cials dealt closely with a remaining brother in Constantinople and

regularly intervened with Venetian authorities on the family’s behalf.∑≥ The ques-

tion remained, however, whether Jews were Venetians, Ottomans, or some privi-

leged, interstitial group. The various ‘‘nations’’ that composed the Jewish univer-

sità epitomized in many ways the multivalence of identity in the Mediterranean

world: they moved easily between religious, political, and economic poles and

were often a confusing anomaly within the body politic wherever they resided.

r e n e g a d e s

Jews were not the only group alleged to know no frontiers. In recent years

much has been written about the chrétiens d’Allah, the many men and women who

migrated from Christianity to Islam, and in so doing violated what was perhaps

the most elemental boundary of early modern societies.∑∂ In Christendom these

individuals were termed renegades; in Islamic lands they were welcomed as

converts.∑∑ The period from 1500 to 1650 represents the golden age of the rene-

gade; their numbers were so great that the ﬂow from Christianity to Islam has

been characterized as a ‘‘hemorrhage of men’’ and a ‘‘religious nomadism.’’∑∏

It is impossible to establish the renegades’ actual numbers, but travelers and

other observers o√er at least an impressionistic sense. Arnold von Har√ in 1496

reported ﬁfteen thousand renegades in the service of the Egyptian sultans.∑π

Writing a century later, Diego de Häedo estimated that renegades constituted

almost half the population of Algiers, approximately six thousand households, or

sixty thousand people. These ﬁgures are clearly exaggerated, however, as the city’s

total population was probably no more than seventy-ﬁve thousand.∑∫ Fifty years

later the French Trinitarian Father Dan counted eight thousand men and twelve

hundred women renegades in Algiers, and three to four thousand men and six to

seven hundred women in Tunis.∑Ω Whatever their numbers in individual cities,

scholars generally agree that in the sixteenth-century Mediterranean, renegades

numbered into the hundreds of thousands.∏≠

Though renegades ﬂed from all over Europe, the majority came from areas

bordering the Mediterranean. In southern Italy, especially Calabria, the ‘‘consis-

tent ﬂight of men toward the Ottoman Empire,’’ had the ‘‘character of a social

revolt.’’ Observers were struck by the number of renegades, and the ease with

"
133,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

113

which seemingly impassable religious frontiers were regularly breached. Della

Valle noted chidingly that ‘‘you could not believe . . . the ease that there is in many

people in renouncing the faith.’’∏∞ If religion was one of the most important

constituent parts of identity in the premodern world, then the presence of so

many who traversed boundaries of belief suggests the malleability of even this

aspect of identity.

The motivations behind conversion were myriad, but the most important are

suggested in Blount’s observation: ‘‘Many who professe themselves Christians

scarce know what they mean by being so; ﬁnally, perceiving themselves poore,

wretched, taxed, disgraced, deprived of their children and subject to the intol-

erance of every Rascall, they begin to consider and prefer the present World,

before the other which they so litt le understand.’’∏≤ Poverty, ignorance, oppres-

sion, and the hope of better socioeconomic conditions all were powerful motiva-

tions for religious nomadism. Many renegades resulted from the constant Medi-

terranean corsair activity: slaves, in an attempt to better their desperate condition,

often felt compelled to convert. Still others converted to escape complications in

the Christian world, to start a new life, or simply in search of adventure. Cynical

Christians believed that men converted because Islamic laws permitted multiple

wives, and in French literature the most frequent cause of apostasy was erotic, a

prisoner caught in ﬂagrante delicto in the arms of a Muslim wife, widow, or

daughter. The famous renegade kapudanpa¸sa Çigalazade Sinan Pa ¸sa (also Cicala,

Ca ˘galazade) was motivated to renounce Christianity in return for the release of

his father, who along with his son had been captured by corsairs.∏≥ A Mediterra-

nean saying of the time suggests still another motivation: ‘‘out of spite, I will

become a Turk.’’∏∂ Antonio Fabris summarizes well the varied motivations of

conversion: ‘‘We are dealing with artisans driven by a yearning for income, with

Europeans, slaves of Muslims, desirous of a better life, with men greedy for

adventure or in search of a power precluded them in the West.’’∏∑ It is not surpris-

ing that periods of increased conversion usually coincided with crises in Euro-

pean society, economic depression, and religious and / or political persecution.∏∏

As these passages suggest, many renegades were inspired by reports, which

circulated widely, that Islamic society knew no ‘‘social discrimination or privi-

leges’’ and that opportunity existed for all, regardless of background.∏π Contempo-

raries noted the attractiveness of this world without perceived social barriers: an

ecclesiastic noted that men ‘‘have themselves circumcised hoping to achieve a

more excellent rank.’’ Blount echoed this sentiment: ‘‘Generally I found them

Atheists, who left our cause for the Turkish as [being] . . . fuller of preferment.’’∏∫

Luther believed that one explanation for Ottoman military success was the ‘‘social

"
134,"114

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

injustice’’ of the time, evidenced during the peasant revolts by the ﬂight to Islam

of common folk, who looked on the Ottomans ‘‘as possible deliverers from op-

pression.’’∏Ω This popular perception was not unfounded: in early modern Mus-

lim societies, birth meant less than ‘‘merit, audacity, savoir-faire . . . Many men,

condemned by the status of their birth in Christianity to a subordinate condition,

saw themselves o√ered marvelous opportunities for social promotion.’’π≠ Exam-

ples of men of low station in Christendom rising to the summits of the Ottoman

state were well known throughout Europe. Indeed, the baili in Constantinople

had to grapple regularly with men, women, and sometimes families who came to

the city seeking entry into the divan, hoping to be awarded some o≈ce in return

for their conversion and the information they claimed to possess.

Just as rumors of a more open society intrigued Europe, so too did the belief

that renegades could make their fortunes. For example, a Jew in Venice told a

friend of the ‘‘astounding news of the prosperity swift ly attained by the convert in

the lands of the Ottoman Empire.’’π∞ Renegades were often seen as the bene-

factors of their native lands, the local man (or woman) made good who might

share his (or her) newfound wealth at least in part with family and paesani. Not

infrequent ly renegades maintained close economic ties with their families, and

Scara≈a speaks of ‘‘Euro-Barbaresque family businesses that saw members of

the same family, in part renegades in part Christians, involved in the same busi-

ness.’’ One such ﬁgure was the Genoese renegade Gia√er, kadı in Tunis, who was

at the center of a trade and slave-exchange network between a cousin in Marseilles

and a brother in Genoa.π≤

A brief survey of the cases of several renegades suggests the variety of potential

motivations to convert. Niccolò Algarotti, a Venetian merchant in Cairo, accrued a

large debt spending lavishly and gambling with Muslims, and became a ‘‘Turk’’ to

achieve a change of venue for his case to an Ottoman court, hoping to receive a

favorable judgment from the kadı. Another merchant converted to avoid paying

debts and returning goods that he owed to several important merchants in Ven-

ice. These conversions for commercial motivations were common enough to be

dramatized in Robert Wilson’s play Three Ladies of London (1581–84).π≥ The reg-

ularity of such conversions led the baili to obtain a ﬁrman stating that if Venetian

agents turned to Islam, their goods were to be returned to their principals.π∂

Ladislaw Mörten, the majordomo of the Holy Roman ambassador in Con-

stantinople, committed ‘‘a capital crime’’ and was conﬁned to the embassy. He

shouted out the window that he wanted to become a ‘‘Turk’’ and was taken to the

divan, where he was rewarded with a lucrative o≈ce. Another man in the imperial

"
135,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

115

entourage converted in response to the o√er of a horse and an o≈ce worth twenty

akçe a day. Giovanni Moro reported meeting two men being sought by the pope,

who ‘‘not knowing how to save themselves . . . ﬂed to Turkey, and to avoid being

made slaves there, became Turks.’’π∑

Renegades were not limited to the lower classes: Girolamo Fasaneo was a

Dalmatian lawyer banished with a price on his head as a result of a controversy

with a local Venetian o≈cial. In requesting rescission of the banishment, he

warned that he would ‘‘be constrained to become a Turk,’’ which he ultimately

did, and he immediately turned to the Ottoman courts ‘‘to obtain the justice that

he felt had been denied him by Christians.’’π∏ It was not uncommon for educated

Christians, or those possessing specialized knowledge, to convert in hopes of

using their skills to advance and prosper, such as the German military engineer

trained in artillery and fortress design who came to Constantinople to convert at

the invitation of several Jews. Geo√rey Parker has found many instances of Euro-

pean renegades who served Muslim masters in Kongo, Calicut, and Malabar.

Indeed, he argues that in the Ottoman Empire the founding and management of

artillery ‘‘became the exclusive preserve of small cadres of foreign specialists,

most of them renegades and adventurers.’’ππ

Individual conversions were the norm, but occasionally larger groups con-

verted en masse. One example is the French mercenary contingent defending the

Habsburg frontier garrison at Papa in Hungary, which defected collectively in

1600, in part because their pay was months in arrears. Military defections were

common: Bennassar has found records of many soldiers who abandoned their

posts in Spain’s Algerian citadels of Oran and Mers el-Kébir for Islam. The rea-

sons are clear: ‘‘the impossibility of honoring their debts, bad luck gambling, a

quarrel with a comrade, the threat of a sanction, the ragging of a superior,’’ as well

as hunger and pay sometimes several years in arrears. A Seville court found that

in a twelve-year span, some ﬁve hundred soldiers had abandoned the forts due to

their ‘‘extreme penuriousness.’’ Many of them became Ottoman mercenaries,

and some of their leaders even were awarded important positions with the sul-

tan’s forces. Others ﬂed their posts believing that they had a better chance to

return home through being freed by the priests in the region who redeemed

slaves, or that they could earn enough as Ottoman soldiers to return to Spain and

confess before the Inquisition, rather than serving their sentences in Spain’s

frontier fortresses.π∫ In 1579–80 ﬁve Maronite villages in Syria converted en

masse, and as did two groups of a thousand and four hundred inhabitants of

Cosenza in Calabria, ‘‘who were not able to tolerate the government of the Span-

"
136,"116

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

ish in those parts.’’ And in perhaps the most curious mass conversion, at Chios

some three hundred Christians publicly converted to Islam, with the approval of

their Jesuit pastors, though in secret they continued to live as Christians.πΩ

While the river of renegades generally ﬂowed from Christianity to Islam,

movement in the other direction was not unheard of.∫≠ Simone Contarini, for

example, reported meeting a man in Corfu ‘‘who though he once was a Turk, he

became however a Christian, and lives here with his wife and children.’’∫∞ Eco-

nomically motivated conversions were not limited to Christians: there were fre-

quent instances of Muslim merchants in Venice becoming Christians and de-

camping with the goods of their principals, often important Ottoman o≈cials,

prompting requests from Constantinople for o≈cial Venetian intervention.∫≤ A

Muslim in the household of the grand vizier stole goods valued at almost a million

akçe, sold them in Venice at a public auction, and renounced his faith, which

provoked a request for direct intervention by the doge; in another instance, an

Ottoman o≈cial in Venice loaned funds to a fellow Muslim there who was down

on his luck; the man absconded and went to the Duke of Florence ‘‘to become a

Christian.’’ Early in the sixteenth century, Piero Bragadin reported on seventy

janissaries ‘‘with wives and children’’ who ﬂed to Candia and whom Venetian

authorities agreed to assist as they had done previously in similar cases.∫≥ Political

circumstances motivated some Muslim apostasies: the Ottoman historian Naima

wrote of a governor of Syria who after protracted hostilities with a grand vizier, ‘‘to

save his own life became a French proselyte, . . . promising he would assist a

French army in acquiring a conquest in the environs of Jerusalem.’’∫∂ Muslim

women also occasionally converted, such as the young bride of an Ottoman kadı

who ﬂed with her mother and two sisters to Venetian lands and converted to

Christianity, and the three Muslim converts who hid in a Greek nunnery.∫∑

Violations of religious boundaries in the early modern era were not limited to

Islam and Christianity. The most notable example after 1517, of course, is the

many millions of converts to the various Protestant sects. Donia and Fine have

shown that after the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, there were many Roman

Catholic conversions to Islam but also to Orthodoxy because of its favored status

in the empire. Religious change was multidirectional; Islam acquired most con-

verts, but Orthodoxy, too, won many.∫∏ Venetian observers reported several in-

stances of Persian, Shiite Muslims becoming ‘‘Turks’’: Gianfrancesco Morosini

recounted the case of a Persian ambassador who ‘‘renouncing the faith of the

Persians, declared himself a Turk,’’ and Paolo Contarini described a similar oc-

currence. These ‘‘conversions’’ were really political defections, and the fact that

Christian observers interpreted these occurrences in a religious light suggests a

"
137,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

117

fundamental misunderstanding regarding the universal nature of Islam, even

among its various sects.∫π Of course, there are many cases of Jews converting to

Islam and Christianity. Christians also occasionally converted to Judaism: Pullan

cites the case of a Venetian patrician who argued with a Jewish man that Jews

converted to Christianity but never the reverse. The man countered by pointing

out that a Leandro Tisanio, son of a local shoemaker, was living in Thessaloníki as

a Jew. He preferred Judaism’s religious unity to the myriad divisions among

Christians, as well as for certain theological reasons. Also striking is the case of

Ni’matallah, the Syrian Jacobite patriarch, who was so troubled by the problems of

his church that he converted ﬁrst to Islam but ﬁnding ‘‘no peace as a Muslim,’’

ﬂed to Rome and was admitted into the papal fold.∫∫

Although practical economic, social and political catalysts for conversion were

common, it would be wrong to overlook the element of sincere belief and of a

more transcendent religious conversion.∫Ω Religion and belief in the sixteenth

century had meaning and the power to mobilize signiﬁcant passion and commit-

ment. Islam was attractive to some because of its promise of ‘‘eternal health to all

believers.’’ As Blount observed from his many encounters with them, renegades

often ‘‘left our cause for the Turkish as the more thriving in the Word.’’Ω≠ A certain

Pere Bedellia, for example, was initially captured as a boy and became a ‘‘Moor to

the core.’’ He was a janissary for thirteen years, then a corsair; when he was

captured by Christians, instead of revealing his identity, for three and a half years

‘‘he passed himself o√ as a ‘Turk by birth’ ’’ chained in a Christian galley, hoping

to be ransomed and to return to Algiers.Ω∞ Leonardo Donà described a renegade

Venetian noble of the Querini family who had studied Muslim law, went on the

hajj to Mecca, and in general appeared great ly impressed by Islam’s doctrines:

‘‘He says that the life of Venetian gent lemen is more secure than his, but that

here at least he will save his soul.’’ He tried to persuade his mother ‘‘to embrace

that light of salvation that he said God had given to him, by abandoning that

Religion to which she had attempted to persuade him to return.’’Ω≤

While some people converted out of sincere religious conviction, this was

probably not the predominant motivation. Indeed, acceptance of Islam, rather

than conversion, is probably a more accurate description of the nature of religious

refashioning. As Donia and Fine have shown in the case of Bosnia, ‘‘Few Bos-

nians in accepting Islam underwent any deep changes in patterns of thought and

life . . . retaining most of their domestic customs and many Christian practices.’’Ω≥

In the eighteenth century a merchant from Marseilles observed much the same of

two renegades, one of whom continued to drink wine and eat pork after his

conversion and the other who when sick asked a monk to say masses for him.Ω∂

"
138,"118

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

That these conversions in many cases were in name only is evidenced by the

many renegades who returned to Christianity in their twilight years, in some

instances to ﬂee problems encountered in their Muslim lives, in others simply to

die in the bosom of the holy mother church.

In case after case that appeared before the Inquisition, renegades would claim

that their conversion had been solely external, more functional than spiritual, and

that in their hearts they had always remained Christian. The assumption of this

internal-Christian / external-Muslim dichotomy is at the core of an Inquisition

manual of 1625, which suggested a leading dialogue for use in interrogating

renegades: ‘‘At the persuasion of the Turks, and for fear of being mistreated by

them, you had externally renounced the Holy Christian Faith, and said expressly

that you wanted to be a Turk, lifting the ﬁnger . . . and freely allowing yourself to

be circumcised, but retaining from thence onward the Holy Christian Faith in

your heart.’’Ω∑ Instances of renegades who qualiﬁed their conversions as ‘‘in-

complete’’ in this fashion abound: for example, one slave encouraged another to

convert ‘‘because God [knows] the secret of our hearts.’’ In another case, a Greek

woman who was forced to convert by her Muslim husband reassured friends,

‘‘although I am supposed to be a Mahometan, yet I remain a Christian in heart, as

I was before, and perform my customary devotions.’’Ω∏ A man whose whole family

had converted explained to the Pisan Inquisition in 1627 that ‘‘in our house we

lived as good Christians and I did my orations as I used to do here, but outside it

was necessary to live as Turks.’’Ωπ

In a great majority of the cases that appeared before tribunals of the Inquisi-

tion throughout Mediterranean Europe, the men and women were welcomed

back into the fold with litt le or no punishment, their trials being litt le more than a

‘‘bureaucratic practice,’’ their freedom ‘‘a sort of prize for the renegades who had

ﬂed from the hands of the Turks, or those captured at a young age.’’Ω∫ In line with

this general attitude toward penitent renegades, Venice maintained a liberal pol-

icy toward its subjects who returned to Christianity: it did not seek vengeance

against those who wanted to return, and even sought to incite them with gifts and

promises of lucrative jobs as interpreters and brokers.ΩΩ

Although the Inquisition did not censor renegades too severely, both Mus-

lims and Christians often looked upon them with disdain and suspicion. Sherley

described them thus: ‘‘The renegadoes are for the most parte roagues, & the

skumme of people, whyche beinge villanes and atheists, vnable to liue in Chris-

tendomme, are ﬂedde to the Turke for succoure & reley√e.’’ An ecclesiastical

observer considered them ‘‘more villainous, pillagers, insolent, cruel, arrogant,

proud, boasters and ignorant’’ than the average ‘‘Turk.’’∞≠≠ Venetian observers

"

119

often distinguished between ‘‘Turks’’ born and converted and divided the latter

category between forced and voluntary converts. Of these voluntary renegades,

Simone Contarini said, ‘‘there are no worse people found, not even among Turks,

let alone the world, or even in hell.’’∞≠∞ From the Muslim side, Mustafa Ali referred

to converted Slavs as half-Turks and ‘‘Islamicized rogues,’’ and the Bey of Tunis

remarked of renegades, ‘‘a pig still remains a pig, even if they do cut o√ its tail.’’∞≠≤

Converts from Islam to Christianity were also viewed with suspicion: Teodolo

Dandolo, a Persian converted by the patrician Venetian consul in Aleppo, immi-

grated to Venice and held several lucrative o≈ces. Concerns remained, however,

regarding the sincerity of his conversion and his loyalty: ‘‘since he was born a

Turk, even though he has become a Christian, he could always have some greater

inclination toward his nation, not being a [Venetian] subject.’’∞≠≥ Just as with the

Jews, renegades were interstitial individuals whose loyalties were never entirely

clear or beyond reproach.

While some renegades eventually returned to Christianity, the vast majority

probably did not. The growing historiography of the renegades has almost en-

tirely ignored this group, in part, no doubt, because these individuals do not often

appear in the Inquisition records that have been the base of all studies of rene-

gades. Fortunately, the Venetian documentary sources help illuminate this elu-

sive group. One particularly revealing example is Gazanfer A ˘ga.∞≠∂ For many

years, Gazanfer A ˘ga’s origins were something of a mystery: while Hammer and

many other historians described him as being of Hungarian origins, it is clear

from Venetian records that he was born in the Venetian lagoon, perhaps in

Chioggia, sometime around 1550.∞≠∑ He claimed descent from noble parents,

though there was some doubt of this among the patriciate, who believed he might

have come from a natural branch of the Michiel clan, the Ca’ Zorzi, or perhaps

even common stock. He was captured as a boy—with his mother, a brother, and

two sisters— in 1559 while traveling from Budua, a Venetian possession in the

eastern Adriatic where his father held a governmental o≈ce.∞≠∏ His mother and

sisters eventually obtained their freedom, but Gazanfer and his brother, Ca’fer,

were enslaved. Both were sent initially to Hungary and became favorites of the

future sultan Selim II (probably this is the source of Hammer’s mistaken identi-

ﬁcation), who convinced both boys to undergo the knife and become eunuchs so

that they might serve in the imperial harem. Ca’fer died in the operation, but

Gazanfer survived and on Selim’s ascension to the throne in 1566, he accom-

panied the new ruler to Constantinople.∞≠π

Gazanfer A ˘ga, who had ‘‘a lively and penetrating spirit, [which] he developed

"
140,"120

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

through study,’’ advanced rapidly in this setting and by 1580 had risen to the

heights of the Ottoman state. He held simultaneously the two most important

o≈ces within the inner service of the Harem— kapıa˘gası (chief of the gate and of

the white eunuch gatekeepers) and odaba¸si (chief of the Privy Chamber)— and for

a span of more than thirty years he was ‘‘one of the most inﬂuential persons in the

government, . . . a tenure longer than that of any grand vizier.’’∞≠∫ The kapıa˘gası ’s

o≈ce was located at the Gate of Felicity, which led from the outer to the inner

palace. The holder of this o≈ce was ‘‘the sole mediator between the Sultan and

the world outside the Palace.’’ Any person or communication into or out of the

palace was transmitted through the kapıa˘gası.∞≠Ω As one bailo observed, ‘‘There is

ordinarily no one who can give or have given memorials or Arz to the King that it

does not pass through his hands, and he is the one who has the ear of the King for

his every pleasure and who governs the family within the Seraglio.’’∞∞≠ Gazanfer

demonstrated remarkable staying power in a period of great challenge for the

Ottoman Empire and its rulers: he served and advised three sultans over more

than thirty years before his execution in 1603. At his death, Francesco Contarini

reported that the renegade had tried numerous times to leave the seraglio, but

Mehmed III had insisted he stay ‘‘because of the singular a√ection that he bore

for him, keeping him always near by.’’ Whenever important matters appeared

before the sultan, Contarini continued, he always asked his kapıa˘gası ‘‘what he

wanted him to write, and whatever he recommended, without any modiﬁcation,

was written.’’∞∞∞

At the height of his inﬂuence, Gazanfer was part of ‘‘an important network of

inﬂuence in the bosom of the leadership elite’’ in the Porte.∞∞≤ This included a

number of fellow Venetians, as well as the Italian renegade, Çigalazade Sinan

Pa ¸sa. Gazanfer was one of the champions of Çigalazade’s attempts, temporarily

successful, to obtain the grand vizierate and was inﬂuential in the successful

careers of numerous other important Ottoman o≈cials of the later sixteenth

century.∞∞≥ He was a patron of literature, and many appreciable works were dedi-

cated to him; among those who beneﬁted from his largesse was the historian

Mustafa Ali.∞∞∂ So far-reaching was his inﬂuence that he was considered among

the handful of men and women widely believed to dominate the sultans during

the period of the so-called sultanate of the women.∞∞∑

Gazanfer’s demise came much more quickly than had his ascension. In the

troubles that plagued the empire at the turn of the century, the military came to

exercise increasing inﬂuence over their sovereigns and, according to the historian

Naima, ‘‘the sipahi legion requested his majesty, the emperor, to call a divan for

the purpose of taking into consideration the state of the empire, everywhere torn

"
141,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

121

and a∆icted with rebellion and insubordination.’’ Naima attributed Gazanfer’s

fall to his reputation as the power behind the throne, which made him an easy

target as one of the chief ﬁgures responsible for the empire’s problems.∞∞∏ Gazan-

fer was also reported to be highly favored of the sultans but ‘‘much envied of this

people.’’ The sultan tried to protect his favorite: as an English diplomat reported,

the ruler turned over to his soldiers ‘‘all, except one, the Capiaga, his che√e

chamberlen, who he desyred might be spared and presented him; for which he

wold not only give them a liberalitye but encrease of their pay. Towards whom

they [the rebellious troops] seing his fervent love, refused, sayeng they wold have

his headd only, and all the rest their lives should be spared.’’ In the end, to save

himself the sultan was forced to sacriﬁce the Venetian renegade, though he wept

ﬁercely ‘‘for having seen murdered before his very eyes the dearest person that he

had in the world without being able to ﬁnd some remedy.’’∞∞π

The story of Gazanfer A ˘ga is fascinating on a human level, but it also reveals

the complex nature of identity in the early modern era. While he had converted to

Islam at a young age, had lived in Constantinople for much of his adult life, was a

patron of Ottoman letters, and was intimately involved in the government of the

empire, still Gazanfer A ˘ga continued to consider and describe himself as Vene-

tian: he told Girolamo Cappello ‘‘I am still Venetian because I have an interest in

that blood.’’ A close Ottoman ally of Gazanfer’s reported him saying ‘‘he remem-

bers very well his patria, and as a true patriot [ patriota] he would not fail to favor

it.’’ Marco Venier reported similarly that the kapıa˘gası ‘‘protested that he was a

good Venetian, lover and partisan of the patria.’’∞∞∫ Despite his important o≈ces

and his great inﬂuence in the Porte, members of the Ottoman ruling class also

considered Gazanfer a Venetian and chastised him for not using this status in his

favor: the sultana was reported to have told him ‘‘these Venetians, your relatives,

hold you in no account, and you are always ready to favor them.’’ The bailo

Gianfrancesco Morosini acknowledged the complexity of the kapıa˘gası ’s identity:

he described Gazanfer as a Venetian, but also ‘‘a true Turk.’’∞∞Ω

In his early years in the capital, Gazanfer avoided openly treating with and

favoring the Venetians because he did not want to compromise his potentially

unstable position as a renegade in the Ottoman court, a concern very common

among new converts. As Lorenzo Bernardo reported, ‘‘This man has the ear of the

Grand Signor when he wants it, but, either from timidity or for prudence he does

not want to involve himself in negotiations, and especially those of Christians,

and principally of Your Signoria, so as not to enter into suspicion with the Grand

Signor.’’ In another report Bernardo explained further that early on Gazanfer

avoided helping Venice ‘‘to escape the perils that overshadow whoever intervenes

"
142,"122

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

in such matters . . . so as not to give suspicion to anyone as a Venetian.’’∞≤≠ Matteo

Zane believed that something of an anti-Christian atmosphere reigned in Con-

stantinople during this period, in which ‘‘everyone wants to act the good Muslim,

opposing the Christians, and showing themselves their enemies without any

reason.’’∞≤∞ To avoid suspicion, Gazanfer required the baili to visit him clan-

destinely. Agostino Nani described one such visit: ‘‘I went to visit him privately as

usual with just one dragoman, and a few servants, knowing that he did not like it

to be known publicly in the Seraglio and in the Porte that the bailo of Venice had

entered to treat with him, who is a Venetian, therefore he industriously had Ömer

A ˘ga waiting for me to let me in as soon as I had arrived, so that I would not tarry in

the view of the people.’’∞≤≤

If in earlier times Gazanfer was very reticent in treating with and assisting his

patria, in his later years when he had solidiﬁed his power, he became much less

concerned with appearances. Clearly inserted and accepted in his adopted milieu

as Muslim, Ottoman, and high o≈cial, he also willingly accentuated his Venetian

identity to gain favors and beneﬁts for family members still in Venice, even to

the point of personally visiting the baili in their embassy.∞≤≥ In 1584 the Vene-

tian Senate granted a petition from Gazanfer A ˘ga, who invoked his many ‘‘rela-

tives and relations by blood’’ still in Venice and requested that his mother, Fran-

ceschina Michiel, be given the proceeds of a governmental o≈ce, worth ten

ducats monthly. In 1590 the Senate forgave a 350 ducat debt that Gazanfer’s sister

owed as a sign of goodwill to him. In the same year, he tried to obtain a lucrative

o≈ce for his brother-in-law in Venice and received the support of the bailo,

Girolamo Lippomano.∞≤∂ Gazanfer also arranged favorable marriages with Otto-

man o≈cials and lucrative o≈ces for other relations whom he convinced to join

him in Constantinople.∞≤∑ His assistance was not limited to family: in a 1594

document he requested that a Jew, Jacob Parenzo, and his heirs be allowed to

make bread and sell it in the Ghetto, with no tax.∞≤∏

In return for Venice’s assistance in his o≈cial and personal activities, Gazan-

fer increasingly favored his native city’s policies in the Porte. As Francesco Con-

tarini wrote, ‘‘He promised me as a Venetian to protect the negotiations of Your

Serenity, and to provide every favor possible to me.’’∞≤π When the bailo was hav-

ing di≈culty concluding a prisoner exchange with the kapudanpa¸sa, Gazanfer

‘‘showed himself very ready’’ in facilitating the negotiation, resulting in the re-

lease of twenty-ﬁve individuals. Through the e√orts of the kapıa˘gası, his fellow

renegade Çigalazade, who had historically been quite opposed to Venice, softened

his position somewhat, aided by bribes of ‘‘sweet muscat, which he drinks with

great reserve and very secret ly.’’∞≤∫ In another incident, Gianfrancesco Morosini

"
143,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

123

tried to get Gazanfer’s assistance in having the Sancak of Lecca removed, even

going so far as to enlist the assistance of the Ottoman’s mother who was visiting

her son. She remonstrated with him and counseled him ‘‘to do in the future that

which one who was born a Venetian gent leman ought to do in the service of his

patria, in addition to that which he must do as an obligation which every child is

held to do to please his mother.’’ Gazanfer’s response is revealing: he reported he

had many enemies ‘‘watching his every action, and who said he was a Giaur, . . .

and said that for the love of [his mother] he favored Christians more than he

should have, which when it would reach the ears of the Grand Signor could cause

his ruin, and as a result it was necessary to proceed with reservation.’’ Still, he

agreed to intervene as he was safely able in the matter.∞≤Ω

The story of Gazanfer A ˘ga vividly exempliﬁes the multiple, seemingly contra-

dictory poles of identity that might exist within an individual: while it presented

certain potential political complications, Gazanfer’s sense of self permitted Otto-

man and Venetian to coexist. Clearly he was an Ottoman by choice and adoption,

and he was intimately inserted into the highest echelons of the Ottoman leader-

ship; nonetheless, he also retained a clear sense of himself as a Venetian, and felt

an enduring loyalty to and connection with his extended family. The composite

nature of Gazanfer’s sense of his own identity permitted him to beneﬁt his

Ottoman master, Venice, himself, and his family. It was not necessary, indeed

perhaps not even possible, for him to choose one or the other; as contradictory

as it may seem to us, to himself and his contemporaries he was an Ottoman-

Venetian.

Gazanfer A ˘ga’s case while striking, is not exceptional. Another Venetian re-

negade who rose to the summits of the Ottoman hierarchy was Hasan A ˘ga (even-

tually Hasan Pa ¸sa). Despite some disagreement among the various accounts, we

have a fairly detailed picture of Hasan’s life.∞≥≠ Hasan, whose Christian name was

Andretta, was born into a poor Venetian citizen family, the Celesti. At age sixteen,

he was sent to sea ‘‘to earn his living.’’ In 1563 the famed corsair Draghut snatched

him from a galley on which he served as scribe and gave him to another corsair,

‘Ul ¯ug ‘Al¯ı (called Occhiali in Italy). Andretta converted to Islam and came to be

highly favored by his owner, who was said to have stated of the lad ‘‘that he did not

know any[one] more able in the service of the Grand Signor than Hasan Pa ¸sa.’’

Under the patronage of ‘Ul ¯ug ‘Al¯ı Pa ¸sa, Hasan became a highly e√ective corsair

and rose in reputation and o≈cial rank in North Africa, eventually becoming pa¸sa

of Algiers in 1577, and again in 1582.∞≥∞

In this inﬂuential position Hasan achieved great power and wealth. He was

known for his ambition and his ruthless e√ectiveness as a tax collector. He suc-

"
144,"124

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

cessfully claimed one-ﬁfth of the booty of the corsairs under his command, rather

than the traditional one-seventh. He also compelled merchants to sell food to his

agents at a discount and generally collected more and higher taxes from all levels

of Algerian society. Hasan augmented his revenues through active involvement

in the gold and silver trade. So fabled did his wealth become, in fact, that he had to

endure at least one, and perhaps two, conﬁscations of it by the sultan. He was also

known as a harsh master, especially to his Christian slaves, one of whom, for a

time, was the young Cervantes, who wrote of ‘‘a Venetian runagate, who being a

ship-boy in a certain vessel, was taken by Uchiali, who loved him so tenderly as he

was one of the dearest youths he had, and he became after the most cruel runa-

gate that ever lived. He was called Azanaga [Hasan A ˘ga], and came to be very rich,

and King of Algiers.’’∞≥≤ Hasan eventually became kapudanpa¸sa in 1588, in part

through a large gift of slaves and cash to the sultan, a position he held for three

years before dying, perhaps poisoned, as rumor held. He was the last of the

corsair captains in the tradition of Barbarossa to hold this important o≈ce.∞≥≥

As was the case with Gazanfer, Hasan also retained close ties to the Venetian

community in Constantinople and with his patria itself. Whereas Gazanfer seems

to have forgotten much of his native tongue, Hasan had a good remembrance of

it: when Lorenzo Bernardo went to visit him in 1591, he ‘‘spoke for a piece in

Turkish for reputation, in which language it seems he is not very prepared, and

then spoke in Frank very comfortably, interspersing many Spanish words.’’∞≥∂ He

also often registered legal transactions in the Venetian chancellery, and from 1575

retained the services of Cristoforo Bertolotti, a Venetian merchant in Constan-

tinople.∞≥∑ Like Gazanfer, Hasan emphasized his native roots in describing him-

self, saying ‘‘in the end he was born Venetian, [and] he could not forget his

patria.’’∞≥∏ As evidence of his goodwill, on several occasions he did not harm

Venetian ships even though he would routinely sack those belonging to other

European states. He reported, for instance, encountering a Venetian ship trans-

porting grain to Zante from which he did not claim his customary gift; it was

reported that he even o√ered refreshments to the crew and passengers. Hasan

also utilized the bailo to intervene in his business a√airs, asking him to have

certain goods sequestered in Venice and turned over from one agent to another.∞≥π

Hasan left a sister, Camilla, in Venice, and in 1590, after becoming kapudan-

pa¸sa, he sent at least two letters to the doge, written in his own hand, seeking

favorable treatment for her and her husband, ‘‘Marcantonio Vedova, Christian,

relative of our love.’’∞≥∫ In this correspondence he acknowledged the favor Venice

had shown his family and requested that Vedova be made one of the Senate’s

secretaries, one of the most prestigious o≈ces in the Venetian bureaucracy. He

"
145,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

125

admitted that this request was unusual and might even be against Venetian laws,

but he also emphasized that he had worked ceaselessly on Venice’s behalf and

would continue to do. While it appears that Vedova (who traveled to Constanti-

nople to try and obtain a gift of a thousand ducats from his brother-in-law) never

was awarded his o≈ce, Hasan did arrange for Camilla to receive the proceeds of a

rich o≈ce, four hundred ducats annually, and he intervened in another instance

involving the conﬁscation of a bakery that was part of his sister’s dowry.∞≥Ω In

return for these services, Hasan favored Venetian policies as he was able, espe-

cially in matters relating to the troublesome Uskoks.∞∂≠

Like Gazanfer A ˘ga, Hasan was a man of two worlds. On the one hand, he was a

feared and famed corsair and commander of Ottoman naval forces. To a certain

extent he seems to have genuinely embraced his adopted religion, suggesting that

his transformation went beyond the superﬁcial level one often encounters in

forced conversions. When a famine struck Algiers in 1579 and tensions in the city

mounted, Hasan assembled the population and publicly burned three Christian

images. In this way ‘‘the city restated its profoundly Islamic identity in this sym-

bolic recreation of Muhammed’s destruction of the idols in Mecca.’’∞∂∞ On the

other hand, he acknowledged his Venetian roots and considered and described

himself as a Venetian, despite his years away from the city, his renunciation of

Christianity, and his very real awareness of the social limitations of his position in

Venice.∞∂≤ His protean sense of identity seems to have fused Venetian, Ottoman,

Muslim, and familial elements, which he apparent ly inhabited reasonably com-

fortably, and between which he moved as was necessary and appropriate.

The cases of Gazanfer A ˘ga and Hasan Pa ¸sa provide clear evidence that ties and

identities associated with the places and cultures of their births remained impor-

tant among Ottoman elites. As inﬂuential Venetian-Ottomans, both were at the

center of a ring of men of shared regional, religious, political, and cultural ﬁlia-

tion.∞∂≥ Around Gazanfer especially there existed a coterie of men (and several

women) who had renounced their religion, but not, it appears, their cultural and

political identities as Venetians and Venetian subjects. These included Ömer A ˘ga,

a eunuch in the seraglio from Zara who was a close ally and protégé of Gazanfer,

and a Venetian patrician of the Querini clan, Mehmed, captured as a youth, ‘‘who

with his virtue and ability and with the favor of the kapıa˘gası advances each day in

rank, and he aspires soon to be defterdar.’’∞∂∂ Gazanfer’s patronage even extended

to Venetians who had not renounced their faith. Pasqualino Leoni and Antonio di

Cavalli, two important merchants whom Gazanfer ‘‘loved great ly,’’ had access to

his private seraglio and were involved in trade with him; their status with the

Venetian renegade direct ly beneﬁted their commerce and position in Constan-

"
146,"126

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

tinople.∞∂∑ Other Ottoman o≈cials often privileged Venetians to curry Gazanfer’s

favor. In one instance an Ottoman gave a Venetian renegade a high position in his

household to demonstrate his ‘‘favor [for] that nation.’’ He did this to win over

Gazanfer, whom he had alienated by opposing Hasan Pa ¸sa for the admiralty,

which had exposed him politically because Hasan ‘‘has always conserved with

solicitude and with much courtesy the friendship of the kapıa˘gası . . . [Who] has

been able to favor him great ly, and he has always done it because [he is] of the

same patria as the Captain.’’∞∂∏

In the past the associations and a≈nity based on shared backgrounds, such as

Gazanfer and Hasan exhibited, were believed not to have existed. The very idea of

the dev¸sirme was ‘‘to provide the sultan and the central government with an

e≈cient, well-trained and loyal professional army . . . without root and without

ties.’’ This practice, according to one scholar, successfully ‘‘mold[ed] aliens of

widely divergent race and creed to the Turkish type, [in a] process of assimilation,’’

which resulted in a corps of soldiers and bureaucrats highly loyal to the sultans.∞∂π

This view in which the dev¸sirme e√aced all memory of the past was also common

among contemporaries: Nicolay, for example, wrote that the boys of the dev¸sirme

never acknowledged their friends or families and allowed their poor relatives to be

reduced to begging.∞∂∫ Metin I. Kunt, however, has shown that ethnic-regional

a≈nities endured and formed an important network and buttress for those mak-

ing careers within the Ottoman bureaucracy. Indeed, he argues that one ‘‘factor

which seems to have played a signiﬁcant part in shaping the career of an individ-

ual slave was his ethnic and / or regional origin and his relations with others of the

same background in the Ottoman world,’’ or cins solidarity as Kunt calls it. In the

case of the dev¸sirme, ‘‘theoretically, a slave was brought into the system at an early

age so that his identity as a Muslim Ottoman could be established irreversibly.’’ In

practice, however, the children of the dev¸sirme were recruited between fourteen to

eighteen years of age. Thus, ‘‘they remembered their birthplace and exhibited a

special tie to it.’’∞∂Ω

Suraiya Faroqhi likewise has discussed the importance of patronage relation-

ships in the factional life of the early modern divan in which dev¸sirme o≈cials

often associated on basis of common ethnicity. Ultimately this undermined the

system’s e≈cacy. She writes, ‘‘Today we know that to be a kul was not the same as

to be a slave to a private person, and that a kul retained family, regional and

factional loyalties which they needed to ‘ﬁt in’ with their loyalty to the Sultan as

best they might.’’∞∑≠ In a more recent work, Kunt has demonstrated that people in

the palace service often tried to obtain positions for acquaintances and family

members through the dev¸sirme, indeed pages in the palace often provided recom-

"

127

mendations for friends from their villages. This trend was common enough to

attract the disdain of Ottoman commentators: the bureaucrat and historian Geli-

bolulu Ali complained about individuals given positions because they were the

‘‘compatriot of this vezir and brother of that aga.’’∞∑∞ Scara≈a similarly points out

that while there were cases of renegades ‘‘ill with ‘forgetfulness’, who to cancel

every trace of their previous identity’’ became the worst torturers of Christians,

they were rarely the ones who reached the apex of their new world. Rather the

ones who succeeded were those who knew ‘‘how to act as mediators between the

two cultures.’’ Renegades tried ‘‘not to cut o√ the past, but to make the two

di√erent worlds to which they belong[ed] coexist.’’∞∑≤ This is certainly evident in

the cases of Gazanfer and Hasan.

Evidence of the importance of regional and ethnic identities within the Porte

abound. The Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokullu, for example, was born to minor

noble, Orthodox parents in Visegrad in Bosnia. Early on he was earmarked for an

ecclesiastical career and studied with a monk uncle at the important monastery in

Mileseva. When he was taken to Constantinople as part of the dev¸sirme, he was

eighteen years old and had already achieved the deaconate. After reaching the

summit of Ottoman o≈cialdom, he became patron of the Patriarchate of Pe ´c— the

ﬁrst three patriarchs were his brother and two nephews; other family members

received bishoprics in Hercegovina. Sokullu also was protector of his former

monastery school and was responsible for the erection of the bridge on the Drina

made famous by Ivo Andri ´c’s novel.∞∑≥ Though he scaled the heights of the Otto-

man hierarchy, ‘‘this Muslim convert from Bosnia still remembered his child-

hood community (and especially his own family).’’∞∑∂ Indeed, Mustafa Ali com-

plained quite bitterly about Sokullu who ‘‘advanced his relatives and relations

whenever he saw a chance to do so, thus promoting many parvenus and appoin-

ting them to lofty positions. Consequent ly, the ordered system of the a√airs

of mankind was changed in a way, and many of the great men as well as the

common people gulped down bowl after bowl of poison at the banquet of his

e√rontery.’’∞∑∑

Another grand vizier who maintained close ties with his birthplace and culture
was ˙Ibrahim Pa ¸sa, originally born in 1493 or 1494 on the Venetian island of

Parga, o√ Dalmatia, to commoner parents. Kidnapped by corsairs as a youth,
˙Ibrahim became a trusted friend of the future sultan Süleyman, and he parlayed

this friendship into an appointment as grand vizier in 1523, at the expense of a
more experienced rival. ˙Ibrahim held this o≈ce until his death in 1536 and, by all

accounts, e√ectively ruled the day-to-day a√airs of the empire. During his time he

was one of the most inﬂuential ﬁgures in the Porte, though he was not without

"
148,"128

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

enemies. He led the successful invasion of Hungary in 1526, which saw the

Hungarians routed at the Batt le of Mohács and their young king, Louis II, killed

on the batt leﬁeld,∞∑∏ and in 1534 he assumed command of the war with the pesky

shah of Persia and captured Baghdad and Mesopotamia.∞∑π

The Venetian vizier did not hide his connections to his past; indeed, he was a

frequent visitor to Galata where he patronized European artists and watched

ballets on classical themes. Under his inﬂuence, both his mother and father

converted to Islam, though rather half-heartedly: they described themselves as

‘‘a√ectionate to our most illustrious Signoria, . . . we know well that we were born
subjects.’’ ˙Ibrahim, like Sokullu, used his position to beneﬁt his family and the

state of his birth. He procured positions for two brothers in the palace, as well as

an important o≈ce for his father, and ‘‘was largely responsible for the good

standing of [the] son of the doge,’’ the bastard Alvise Gritti, one of the sultan’s
most important advisers. ˙Ibrahim was generally favorably inclined to Venice’s

political and diplomatic position and avowed that he ‘‘great ly loved the Signoria

since he was born under its dominion,’’ and he described himself as a subject of

the republic. The Venetians saw his favor as a key to their successful balancing act

between the Habsurgs and Ottomans in the 1520s and 1530s. Indeed, one bailo
went so far as to recommend Christian prayers for ˙Ibrahim’s safe return from the

front.∞∑∫ Ultimately, this interstitial position, in combination with political machi-
nations in the palace, led to ˙Ibrahim’s downfall, and he was strangled, during a

lunch with Süleyman.∞∑Ω His meteoric rise to power and subsequent fall provided

great fodder for European novelists and playwrights. Rouillard records three
seventeenth-century dramas which portray the story of ˙Ibrahim, and a vast four-

volume work by Mlle de Scudéry, Ibrahim ou l’illustre Bassa, 1641, further assured

the romantic perpetuation of the vizier’s tragic story.∞∏≠

Çigalazade, as we have already seen, was another renegade who maintained

close ties with his family, whom he tried to convert, or at least to beneﬁt through

his inﬂuence, as when he obtained the duchy of Naxos for his brother Carlo.∞∏∞ In

another case, an Albanian-born grand vizier was described as ‘‘very inclined’’ to

men of his region and language, regardless of their religion.∞∏≤ Such shared

identities often beneﬁted Venetian dragomans of the same region but from the

Venetian side of the border, who emphasized regional over political and even

religious identities in order to facilitate their access to and negotiations with

o≈cials at the highest levels of the Ottoman government. Salignac reported in

1606 that Venice was giving Ragusa the island of Auguste, which he thought

would make the kapudanpa¸sa ‘‘more softened . . . on their position, as he is Slav by

birth (de nation) and a√ectionate to the Ragusans.’’∞∏≥ A renegade Venetian sub-

"
149,"j e w s , r e n e g a d e s , a n d e a r l y m o d e r n i d e n t i t y

129

ject from Arbe, ‘‘a Turk here for many years . . . a person of much honor, of good

repute, who was previously Chief Horse Trainer of the late Grand Signor,’’ re-

quested that the Senate award his brothers a small villa or some properties in their

homeland, a request supported by the kapudanpa¸sa and the bailo. There were so

many Serbs in the Porte that Serbian became a ‘‘private patois’’ in the Ottoman

court; Süleyman may have spoken it as well.∞∏∂

Even among women of the harem memories and identities remained vivid:

the Sultana N ¯ur B ¯an ¯u who was captured by Barbarossa and became mother of

Murad III (whom she allegedly had baptized as a baby), retained her identity as

Venetian throughout her life. Though she was almost certainly of Corﬁot com-

mon stock, after her rise to prominence in the imperial harem, she began to

depict herself as a Venetian noble. Venetian o≈cials were privately skeptical of

this claim, but publicly they embraced the ﬁction. This beneﬁted them as N ¯ur

B ¯an ¯u regularly intervened to prevent policies unfavorable to Venice’s interests

and territories. The Sultana’s case is also suggestive of the power of regional,

cultural roots, as ‘‘even after rising to the vertex of the Ottoman state, this Greek

girl . . . of elevated social status, native of a Venetian colony, probably imbued from

childhood by Venetian social values, apparent ly preferred to be considered as a

scion of a Venetian patrician family.’’∞∏∑

The numerous cases studied in this chapter suggest the need to revise the way

in which we understand identity in the early modern Mediterranean world. Iden-

tity in this era, both individual and group, was much more complicated than

simple adherence to modern notions of religious or political belonging. The

experiences of Jews such as Righetto or David Passi and of Gazanfer A ˘ga, Hasan

Pa ¸sa, and the many other renegades who populated the Ottoman Empire clearly

illustrate the degree to which even the most elemental boundary— religion—was

crossed and re-crossed in the early modern Mediterranean. Their cases also sug-

gest the degree to which cultural and geographical provenance, as expressed in

the elusive idea of nation, constituted a central element in the mosaic of identity.

Though this boundary was often breached, changing one’s religion did not mean

replacing or abandoning some former, essentialized self. Indeed, conversion sig-

niﬁed simply a complication of identity, an addition to the important regional,

ethnic, religious, and familial elements that were at the core of self and commu-

nity in this period.

Merchants, Patricians, Citizens, and

Early Modern Identity

The cases of Gazanfer A ˘ga and Righetto are fascinating and suggest the mallea-

ble and composite nature of early modern identities. It would not be unreasonable

to argue, however, that because Jews and renegades existed on the margins, their

experiences cannot be seen as normative. To a degree it is true that these groups in-

habited the interstices of society, but we should not ignore the fact that they also cir-

culated in and participated at all levels of Ottoman society. This is particularly true

of the renegades, who penetrated Ottoman society so completely precisely because

they were not anomalous; their experience of ‘‘migration and conversion’’ was not

uncommon in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In fact, between 1453 and

1623, thirty-three of the forty-eight grand viziers were of Christian extraction.∞ The

chameleonlike qualities renegades displayed seem to be emblematic of a much

broader ambiguity in issues of identity in the early modern Mediterranean, partic-

ularly among the admixture of cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and religious groups

that composed what one scholar has described as the ‘‘Levantine subculture.’’≤ The

pliancy and porosity of identic boundaries is also evident among members of the

commercial and diplomatic core of the o≈cial Venetian community in Con-

stantinople, as well as on a broader, communal level by the Perots, the small group

of Latin-rite Ottoman subjects who inhabited Galata and Vigne di Pera.

m e r ch a n t s

As chapter 2 shows, the label ‘‘merchant of Venice’’ in early modern times was

a facade that masked a heterogeneous and ambiguous physiognomy. Venetian

"

131

Levantine commerce from 1540 on was carried out almost exclusively by non-

noble agents. Legally, these merchants had to be Venetian citizens, born or natu-

ralized; in practice most were the latter. Many came from Venice’s empire; others

were not even culturally Venetian or Italian. There were also numerous instances

of merchants trading in the Venetian nation who never obtained citizenship, and

some were even Ottoman subjects. The archetypal Venetian merchant, then, was

Venetian not by birth but by adoption, which suggests the degree to which mer-

chant identity shared the malleability and adaptability demonstrated by renegades

and Jews.

The experience of one of these naturalized merchants and a longtime member

of the Venetian nation in Constantinople, Marcantonio Stanga, illuminates the

variability of early modern merchant identity. Stanga was born in Cremona but

spent most of his adult life trading in Syria and Constantinople. He came to

Constantinople sometime around 1550 and resided in the city until his death in

1593. Stanga owned a house and vineyard in Galata, and though he appears not

to have married, he did produce a son with a slave he owned. He was not a

particularly wealthy merchant, but he was well known and respected by impor-

tant Ottoman and Venetian o≈cials. There is no evidence that Stanga lived for

any length of time in Venice, yet in 1564 the V Savii recommended him for full

de intus et extra citizenship, emphasizing his many years as a merchant and

the income he had brought the city, despite the fact that he did not meet the

residency requirement.≥

During the War of the Holy League, Stanga led an interesting double life. At

the outbreak of the war, Venetian merchants in Constantinople were imprisoned

and their goods conﬁscated (as happened to Ottoman merchants in Venice). In

anticipation, ‘‘for the security of his person and merchandise,’’ Stanga refash-

ioned himself as the o≈cial treasurer, and therefore a member, of the French

nation in Constantinople. Some charged that Stanga became an Ottoman subject

during the war to protect his commercial activities, though he vehement ly denied

the accusation. Despite this transmutation, throughout the war Stanga remained

closely a≈liated with the Venetian nation as a key link in the communication

network between the imprisoned bailo, Marcantonio Barbaro, and Venice. He

received and sent crucial communications in his own mail and passed these on

surreptitiously in the church of San Francesco. The Council of Ten declared that

‘‘if it had not been for Mr. Antonio Stanga,’’ communication would have been

impossible ‘‘because of the great guard that was around this bailo.’’∂

After the peace of 1573, Stanga returned to the Venetian nation, to the dismay of

the French ambassadors. Because of Stanga’s serial self-refashioning, his death in

"
152,"132

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

1593 precipitated a struggle over his estate among French, Venetian, and Ottoman

authorities, who all claimed him as their own. Venice maintained that Stanga had

been a citizen of the city since 1564; the French claimed him because ‘‘at the time

of the last war he had made himself a French subject’’; and the Ottomans alleged

that because of his long residency, the property he owned in Galata, and a bastard

son he had fathered there, he was a haracgüzar of the sultan.∑ Stanga’s identity was

furthered complicated by the revelation that since at least 1582 he had served the

Spanish crown as one of its ‘‘most esteemed spies in Constantinople,’’ reporting

regularly on the activities of the Venetian baili and activities in the Porte. In-

deed, Marcantonio Stanga was not even his real name; he was born Bartolomeo

Pusterla.∏ While clearly an opportunist, Bartolomeo Pusterla alias Marcantonio

Stanga seems a good example of the malleability of political identity in this period

and the importance of his vocational identity as a merchant in this calculus.

Stanga migrated from non-Venetian to citizen, citizen to French subject, perhaps

Ottoman subject as well, back to Venetian citizen, all the while serving as a

Spanish informer.

The shifting sense of political a≈liation demonstrated by Stanga /Pusterla is

also evident in another Venetian merchant, Poloantonio Bon. Bon ﬁrst appears

listed as a Venetian merchant in Constantinople in 1604, and he reappears spo-

radically to 1611. Cristoforo Valier described him as a Venetian, ‘‘though married

in this land,’’ suggesting his may have been a more permanent union than the

concubinage normally practiced by expatriate merchants.π In Constantinople,

Bon moved among the highest circles of both Ottoman and European society: he

was a silk and wool merchant who traded with the most important Venetians and

other merchants, including the English ambassador. His most signiﬁcant com-

mercial and political connection was with the inﬂuential Ottoman o≈cial, Halil

Pa ¸sa, whom he served as a dragoman for some time.∫

Halil Pa ¸sa was key in bringing Dutch merchants into the Levant; as part of his

e√orts, he o√ered Bon, an ‘‘essential functionary from his own entourage,’’ as

dragoman to the new Dutch ambassador, Cornelius Haga. The existing trading

nations in Constantinople, led by Venice, had worked mightily to block the intro-

duction of a new and potent competitor into their markets. Unable to convince

the Ottomans to keep out the Dutch, the baili tried to use their inﬂuence as head

of Bon’s nation to dissuade the merchant from entering the service of a competi-

tor, though with no success. Bon’s relationship with his new patron proved short-

lived, however, as within a year he and Haga had a falling out. Having alienated

both the Venetians and the Dutch, Bon attempted to obtain satisfaction by taking

the matter to the divan, probably with the hope of leveraging his relationship with

"
153,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

133

Halil Pa ¸sa in his favor. This too failed, and the Ottoman grandee withdrew his

support. Unwilling to abandon his grievance, Bon next wrote the States General

about Haga’s dissolute lifestyle and large debts, trying in this way to achieve his

objectives. The last record of Bon was from Cyprus, where he passed in 1614 on

his way to Holland.Ω

Stanga and Bon were not exceptional among Venice’s merchants in Constan-

tinople. The Gagliano brothers provide another example of the fuzzy and elas-

tic nature of identity in the Venetian merchant nation. Edoardo and Domenico

Gagliano were among the most active and successful merchants in the late six-

teenth century, trading between Venice, Ragusa, Constantinople, and as far aﬁeld

as Poland-Lithuania.∞≠ The brothers’ trade network included Venetian patricians

and cittadini, merchants and ambassadors of other European states, numerous

Ottoman traders—Christian, Jewish, and Muslim— and even the highest o≈cials

in the Porte.∞∞ They also operated several ships, at least two of which were foreign-

built but declared Venetian by the Senate at the Gaglianos’ request.∞≤ Domenico

was a well-known merchant in Venice, and he used his reputation to beneﬁt

colleagues and acquaintances in legal matters before various Venetian magis-

tracies. The Gagliano brothers, then, would appear exemplary merchants of Ven-

ice. Except that they were not Venetian at all, but rather Latin-rite subjects of the

Ottoman sultans.∞≥

The details of the Gaglianos’ early life are sketchy: they appear to have origi-

nally come from Ragusa where they were part of an important local banking

family. Domenico ﬁrst went to Venice in 1575 to live and work with his uncle

Domenico, who appears to have become by then a Venetian citizen. The younger

Domenico resided in the city almost continuously to the end of his life. He mar-

ried a Venetian woman who bore several children. At his uncle’s death, Domenico

took over the family business, and resided in the parish of Santa Maria Mater

Domini, where he maintained a large household, until at least 1624. He also

owned a number of houses and shops throughout the city as well as properties on

the terraferma. In 1603, after more than twenty-eight years of residency, Do-

menico requested and received de intus et extra citizenship status. In its recom-

mendation, the V Savii noted that Domenico was ‘‘a merchant with a good name,

and with his commerce and navigation of several ships he and his uncle have

brought much beneﬁt to [Venice]’s customs and trade.’’∞∂ Citizenship technically

opened the door to Domenico’s participation in the Levantine trade, which he had

already been actively engaged in for many years, as he traveled to and from

Constantinople and traded as a member of the Venetian nation there.∞∑

While Domenico lived out his life in Venice and became a citizen, his brother

"
154,"134

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Edoardo sett led and did business in Constantinople. Edoardo ﬁrst appears in the

rosters of the Council of Twelve in 1582, and remained one of the most active

merchants of the Venetian nation until 1606.∞∏ His fellow merchants regularly

elected him to positions of importance in the nation: in 1595 he was selected to

supervise the recovery of a ship that had gone down with the goods of many of the

nation’s merchants aboard; the next year he was chosen to oversee the sticky

issues surrounding the failure of a Venetian merchant; in 1598 he was elected to

one of the most important o≈ces in the merchant nation, sindico (assistant) to the

capo dei mercanti. Further evidence of Edoardo’s inﬂuence is the 1602 command-

ment from the sultan to the kadıs of Constantinople and Galata describing him as

the ‘‘representative of the merchants of Venice’’ and enjoining their cooperation

in the fulﬁllment of his responsibilities.∞π

Despite his prominence in the nation, Edoardo never was a Venetian citizen;

rather he remained a subject of the sultan his entire life.∞∫ He maintained a house

in the Vigne di Pera near the seraglio there, married the daughter of a local

Ottoman-Christian merchant, and raised two daughters to adulthood, having lost

another daughter and a son in their youth.∞Ω Like his brother Domenico in Venice,

Edoardo was an important landholder with numerous properties in both Galata

and Vigne di Pera, including houses, shops, vineyards, and garden plots, which

he rented to other Venetian merchants and locals.≤≠ He regularly served in the

community of the sultan’s Latin-rite subjects in positions of importance: in 1584

he was procuratore of San Francesco; in 1603 he was procuratore of the Holy Land.

He was also elected to one of the highest civic o≈ces in the Latin-rite commu-

nity, prior of the Magniﬁca Comunità.≤∞ Edoardo was respected among Ottoman-

Muslims as well. He was designated by an inﬂuential çavu¸s as an arbitrator in a

commercial dispute with a Venetian merchant, and he often stood as guarantor in

matters between Venetian and Ottoman-Muslim merchants. He was an intimate

of high-level Ottoman o≈cials, including Çigalazade Sinan Pa ¸sa; he conveyed

letters from the renegade to family members in Christendom, all the while re-

porting on their contents to the baili.≤≤ In 1599, when Constantinople was su√er-

ing a severe food shortage, certain Ottoman ministers approached Edoardo with a

proposal that he bring food into the city on his ships, which would not be charged

any duties. In another instance, in an extended dispute with an Ottoman-Muslim

merchant, the kadı of Galata kept Edoardo apprised of his adversary’s strategy and

worked to resolve the matter in Gagliano’s favor.≤≥

Legally, Edoardo should not have been permitted to trade as a Venetian, yet for

years he did just that. This was no case of mistaken identity: for over two decades

he was publicly recognized as a ‘‘citizen of Pera’’ and ‘‘Perot,’’ and thus an Otto-

"
155,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

135

man subject, and yet again and again the chancellery records referred to him as a

Venetian citizen and a ‘‘Venetian gent lem[a]n and merchant.’’ When Gagliano

was involved in a commercial dispute, Agostino Nani wrote the Senate that he

would ‘‘not fail to assist him,’’ even though, as Nani added in code, Gagliano ‘‘is a

haracgüzar, . . . [and thus] one may encounter some greater di≈culty.’’≤∂ Clearly

Venice and its o≈cials were aware of Edoardo’s split identity.

In many ways the Gagliano brothers’ trading company, with its various family

members located in di√erent Mediterranean ports, resembles the familial part-

nerships of Jewish merchant families in this period. Maintaining or obtaining

citizenship or subject status from the two dominant eastern Mediterranean pow-

ers was clearly a strategy for developing and protecting family capital. In the case

of the Gagliano brothers, this had been going on for at least two generations:

Edoardo’s and Domenico’s father, Benetto, was trading with the Venetian nation

in Constantinople already in 1545, just about the time that their uncle, Domenico,

established himself in Venice.≤∑ Edoardo’s marital alliances provide additional

evidence of these family strategies. One daughter, Isabeta, wed Thomaso Navon

(Naon), a Latin-rite, Ottoman subject of Genoese ancestry who was a dragoman of

the Venetian nation; Libania, his other daughter, married an Orthodox Greek

‘‘gent leman’’ who was also an Ottoman subject.≤∏ When Venetian fortunes in

Constantinople started to wane, Edoardo began to broaden his associations to

include increasingly close ties with the French merchant nation, much as Stanga

had done in 1570– 73. He eventually became a consul for the French in the early

seventeenth century, and after 1606 he seems to have ceased entirely his involve-

ment with Venetian merchants.≤π While it is not clear what precipitated this break,

it was perhaps related to suspicions that Edoardo was part of the Spanish spy

network in Constantinople.≤∫

The multivalence of Edoardo’s identity is also evident in his use of the Vene-

tian and Ottoman justice systems. At the death of his uncle in Venice, there arose

a disagreement over the division of the inheritance that pitted him and Domenico

against their sister, Caterina, who was married to a Venetian dragoman in Galata.

In order to sett le the matter ‘‘amicably,’’ the litigants agreed initially to submit to

the bailo’s judgment and, as was a standard requirement in accepting Venetian

jurisdiction, to avoid taking the matter before the local Ottoman kadı. Indeed, the

agreement explicit ly stated that both parties would accept the decision of the

arbitrators selected to consider the matter, and that neither would have recourse

to Ottoman justice.≤Ω This agreement broke down when the opposing camps

refused to abide by the bailo’s sett lement, and over the next several years Edoardo

and the other litigants turned to Galata’s kadı court in an e√ort to maximize

"
156,"136

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

their portions of a Venetian inheritance matter. At the same time they continued

to pursue the matter before a series of Venetian magistracies. The strategy of non-

Muslim use of Ottoman courts when communal institutions failed, and playing

the magistracies of various polities o√ each other, was exceedingly common in the

early modern period.≥≠ Eventually the Gagliano matter was resolved by Bailo Giro-

lamo Cappello, as the estate, valued at 680,000 akçe, was divided with twenty per-

cent going to Caterina, and the remainder split evenly between her two brothers.≥∞

The Gagliano case, like that of Stanga and Bon, clearly suggests the diversity

masked by the label of Venetian merchant; it also reveals the mechanisms and

motivations that permitted a certain ambiguity in merchant identity. The variety

of Venetian merchants’ backgrounds and their objectives made their Venetian-

ness a part, but clearly not the all-encompassing or exclusive sum, of their identi-

ties. Familial and commercial, much more than religious or political, consider-

ations seem to have been at the core of the Gaglianos’ identity. Although in all

three of these cases, the merchants had close ties to Venice and the nation and

were highly respected and inﬂuential members of it at di√erent points in their

lives, this association did not prevent them from reconﬁguring themselves as

members of other nations or from pursuing justice or advancement in a variety of

forums, regardless of their political status. Their sense of identity clearly com-

prised a multiplicity of focuses and was adaptable and ﬂexible as situations per-

mitted or dictated.

p a t r ic i a n s a n d c i t i z e n s

As the merchants’ stories suggest, identity in the early modern Mediterranean

was anything but ﬁxed or simple. Due to the transitory and composite nature of

the many regional polities, identity and political status were not often tight ly

intertwined. Within the Venetian state, however, there existed groups whose privi-

leged status might imply a willingness to identify themselves more readily and

closely with their native or adoptive polity. The merchants were one such group;

even more closely tied to the state, however, were the patricians and cittadini

originari. Both groups enjoyed a close association with the ruling institutions of

the Venetian state, and beneﬁted politically, economically and socially from their

favored status. Indeed, for the patriciate, the state was the expression and embodi-

ment of their estate’s political and economic aspirations. Of all the disparate

peoples who constituted the Venetian empire, the patricians and cittadini would

logically be those who most closely identiﬁed with and derived their sense of

identity from their historical relationship to the institutions of the state. Yet even

"
157,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

137

among these privileged castes, the documentary evidence suggests a certain mal-

leability of identity.

In most instances, renegades came disproportionately from the lower eche-

lons of society, those who stood to gain the most socially through conversion and

who may have felt a more tenuous attachment to distant, often mutable sov-

ereigns. Venetian nobles and cittadini originari had the most to lose by abandon-

ing their faith and their state. Patrician conversions, if more rare, did nonetheless

occur. In 1621, for instance, a Venetian ‘‘gent leman’’ of the Lombardo family,

serving as ship’s noble on the Pellegria di Rossi ‘‘became a Turk solely on his own,

spontaneous motivation,’’ after his ship docked in Alexandria.≥≤

We know more about another Venetian patrician convert, Mehmed A ˘ga Frenk-

beyo ˘glu, who was born Marcantonio Querini. Captured as a teen during the War

of the Holy League while serving on the galley of his uncle, Vincenzo Priuli, he

was taken to Constantinople where he embraced Islam. Although there has often

been suspicion about the depth and sincerity of renegades’ conversions among

both contemporaries and modern scholars, Querini seems to have embraced

Islam wholeheartedly. When Leonardo Donà met the renegade noble more than

two decades later, he reported that Mehmed had studied Islamic law and theology

and was convinced that Islam would ‘‘save his soul.’’ He corresponded with

family members in Venice and claimed to have convinced his mother ‘‘to embrace

the light of salvation that God had given him,’’ though she seems never to have

left Venice to join him.≥≥ That in 1597–98 he made the hajj to Mecca also indicates

the depth of his conversion. Aided by his fellow Venetian Gazanfer A ˘ga, Mehmed

Querini progressed rapidly in the Porte, holding several high-proﬁle positions

with the janissary corps and warranting mention in the chronicles of the day.

Eventually he became the commander of all the sipahi; he was killed in the

tumults of 1602 by his own soldiers.≥∂

We also have examples of Venetian cittadini who transgressed the boundaries

of religion, such as Pietro Venier. Venier came to Constantinople in 1626 as a

giovane della lingua, recommended by the Senate for this plum spot because he

had shown great promise in his Turkish language studies in Venice. He not only

remained in Constantinople for his allotted seven years, in 1632 he requested an

extension of his stay, alleging that both of his parents had died in the plague of

1630– 31, ‘‘whence resulted the collapse of all of [his] family a√airs.’’ Less than

three months after this request, Venier secret ly packed his belongings and ﬂed

the embassy under cover of darkness, leaving behind him in his room a sort of

missionary tract instructing ‘‘whoever desires to become a Muslim, what he must

believe, say and do.’’ The bailo, Girolamo Cappello, suggested that Venier was

"
158,"138

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

driven to abandon his prestigious position and became a ‘‘Turk’’ by a combination

of economic trials and a forbidden passion for a woman: Venier, he wrote, had

‘‘fooled himself . . . with the belief (which had been suggested to him) . . . that he

could receive pay at the level of a Sipahi and be free to join with the woman with

whom he had secret dealings.’’≥∑

Following his ﬂight, Venier was able to boast to his nephew, another giovane

della lingua, that he had won the sultan’s favor by being the ﬁrst to show him how

‘‘the glass of Galileo’’ worked, as they used the telescope to spy on the French

ambassador’s house. To further his standing with the sultan, Venier also sought

to pry information about Venetian a√airs from his nephew. In response to this

threat, the bailo discredited the renegade cittadino by spreading misinformation

and slanderous rumors, including the suggestion that Venier had been born ‘‘of a

father [who] passed from Hebrewism to our faith,’’ though the truth of this

assertion is unknown.≥∏

Venier was not the ﬁrst citizen giovane della lingua to abandon his post. Indeed,

one of the ﬁrst young men sent to Constantinople to learn Turkish, a certain

Colombina, converted to Islam in the 1550s and enjoyed a successful career in the

seraglio, no doubt beneﬁting from the linguistic instruction he received in the

bailate. He appears to have played an important role breaking Bailo Vettore Braga-

din’s code in 1566, and in 1578 he was nominated to go as çavu¸s to Venice to an-

nounce the circumcision of the sultan’s son. His saga became a cautionary tale for

subsequent baili against the dangers of sending young men to Constantinople.≥π

Among the best documented cases of a citizen abandoning his privileged

position in Venetian society and refashioning himself as an Ottoman in an at-

tempt to rise higher than his social station in Venice permitted is that of Zuanbat-

tista Locadello. Locadello initially appeared in Constantinople in 1614, and again

in 1616– 17, as a merchant trading with the nation; he returned three years later

with the plum position of secretary to Bailo Giorgio Giustinian. This position was

restricted to the narrow class of Venetian cittadini originari and was highly sought

after. During the next two years Locadello continued to carry on an active trade

while serving as secretary, despite the fact that this violated Venetian law and he

had been chastised by Giustinian for doing so. Locadello ran up substantial debts,

including one of 400,000 akçe to a Venetian dragoman for cloth purchased on his

behalf.≥∫ His largest debts, however, resulted from his dealings with inﬂuential

ﬁgures in the Porte, including the sultana. With his access to the women of the

seraglio, he dared to dream of obtaining no less a prize than the Principality of

Moldavia, in quest of which he advanced the sultana increasing sums of money.

Locadello also tried to gain the support of the ambassador of Poland-Lithuania in

"
159,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

139

Constantinople, promising him a portion of the almost 500,000 thalers in taxes

that the principality allegedly produced. The Venetian also befriended the sons of

the grand vizier, ‘‘by eating and drinking together,’’ and secured their intervention

with their father on his behalf. They helped him obtain accommodations with the

secretary of the vizier, which opened a whole new circle of supporters of his claim.

When it became apparent that because of the strident opposition of the bailo,

Locadello would not receive the post in Moldavia, he turned his attention to

the Duchy of Naxos, less lucrative but still important, but was rebu√ed in this

as well.≥Ω

Eventually, by exposing Locadello’s impending bankruptcy, the bailo was able

to have him imprisoned by order of the grand vizier. Because Locadello continued

to confess and take communion, Giustinian was conﬁdent that he would not

‘‘turn Turk’’ to free himself. But, through the intervention of several Muslim and

Jewish friends, Locadello did in fact convert, and was awarded a position in the

seraglio. In explaining his actions to his father, Locadello claimed he had con-

verted because he feared that the ‘‘bailo had conspired with certain janissaries to

come into the Tower and to strangle me.’’ The bailo’s motivation, according to the

renegade, was to get his hands on some pearls valued at 25,000 ducats: ‘‘Thus to

save my life and to have time to be able to restore our a∆icted household, it was

very necessary for me to do this.’’∂≠

Locadello’s position, however, was not what he had anticipated, as he was

e√ectively sequestered in a ‘‘miserable and most di≈cult’’ situation. He tired very

quickly of the new situation and tried to obtain his freedom, ‘‘declaring that in a

few days he would die of desperation.’’∂∞ Locadello was soon reduced to sending

letters to everyone he knew, including the French and English ambassadors,

imploring assistance and claiming to know the Venetian cipher to try to win

support. But, Giustinian wrote, ‘‘he was derided, and as I appeared not to care

about him or his renouncement at all, as he was a person worth nothing, . . . his

scorn and humiliation grew even greater.’’ In the end, Locadello’s gambit failed,

and he died in the same tower room in which Venier and another renegade

Venetian had been previously held, and where both had apparent ly died at un-

known hands.∂≤

One ﬁnal example of the self-refashioning of a Venetian citizen o≈cial is Paolo

Mariani. Mariani cut a wide swath throughout the Mediterranean in the late

sixteenth century, appearing in the documentary records of most of the states

active in the region. The Englishman John Sanderson served as Mariani’s vice-

consul in Cairo and left a scathing description, which nonetheless suggests the

range of his involvements and inﬂuence: ‘‘Now for Signor Paulo Mariani, as very

"
160,"140

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

atheist as Tipton, a chefe counselour to the ambassiatour. He, after many broyles

and Machievile turmoyles, went consull of Fraunce to Alexandria and Cairo in

Egipt. Ther beinge sett led in his chefest desiered pompe . . . Paulo his witt was a

maker of patriarks and princes, a setter up and pullar downe of them and am-

bassiators, a poysoner and ﬁlthy liver, a warrs and peace maker, a graboyler.’’∂≥

Mariani associated intimately with and often served the English (Sanderson de-

scribes him as Ambassador Barton’s secretary), the French, and Ottomans of

many ranks. Yet Mariani was a Venetian merchant and citizen, probably by birth

rather than privilege, and his brother was a priest in the city.∂∂

In Cairo where he was married and had a child, Paolo and his brother Pietro

dominated the consulates of France, England, and perhaps Venice for the two

decades following Lepanto.∂∑ In 1579 he had rented the o≈ce of French consul in

Cairo from its holder, Cristoforo Vento, in Marseilles, for three and then six years.

When the consulate began making a good income, Vento wanted to regain the

o≈ce and accused Mariani of being a spy and of having drowned a Genoese

merchant in his household. Mariani was able to fend o√ these charges with the

support of several important Ottoman o≈cials. Inquiries by both Ottoman and

Venetian magistrates asserted that the Genoese had died of natural causes. After

the resolution of this a√air, in 1585, Mariani was appointed consul of the English

nation in Cairo, apparent ly holding both consulates simultaneously. At some

point he also became a haracgüzar of the sultan, though there are no surviving

details of the motivations and necessities that drove him to make this move.∂∏

A Venetian serving as an o≈cial for a commercial rival was not in and of itself

unique: Nadalin Testa, for example, was the emin (sultan’s agent) of Alessio

(modern Lezhë), for six years, but this did not prevent him proposing a way to

protect Venetian shipping from corsairs out of Vlora, and describing himself as a

Venetian ‘‘most faithful to Your Serenity.’’∂π Earlier in the century, Marin Sanudo

recorded the departure of two Venetian patricians, Zuanfrancesco Contarini and

Zuan Contarini, who went to Constantinople seeking adventure and positions in

the sultan’s naval forces. A Venetian subject, Niccolò Orlandi, was elected consul

in Cyprus by the V Savii in 1624, and also served as French and Dutch consul

concurrent ly until his death in 1638.∂∫ This practice was ‘‘a dangerous thing and

always of some degree of prejudice,’’ as Alvise Contarini observed, suggesting

that it be forbidden the new consul, but again such a practice was not uncommon

in the dynamic world of eastern Mediterranean ports.∂Ω In the case of Mariani, it is

perhaps more the ease with which he fashioned and refashioned himself repeat-

edly that set him apart.

While serving as consuls of both France and England, Mariani was a close

"
161,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

141

associate and trading partner of the English ambassador or, as Marco Venier

wrote, ‘‘a companion with him [Barton] in his intrigues, a most shrewd person.’’

Indeed, Venier believed that in the relationship with Barton, Mariani was ‘‘the one

who guides this boat.’’∑≠ Despite his close and long-standing association with

Venice’s commercial competitors, Mariani still considered himself (and appar-

ent ly was accepted) as part of the Venetian nation, and he regularly participated in

meetings of the Council of Twelve in Constantinople when he was there. In 1590

he even was selected from the council’s numbers to carry out an inheritance

inquiry for creditors of a deceased goldsmith.∑∞ As a citizen of Venice, though also

an Ottoman subject and an o≈cial of the English and French nations, he still

acknowledged the jurisdiction of the bailo in a matter involving a disputed debt he

and Barton owed to a deceased Venetian merchant.∑≤

Mariani’s identity balancing act ultimately resulted in his death. In 1596,

the French ambassador discovered that yet another Venetian was sending in-

formation on matters in the Ottoman Empire to Spanish ministers in Italy.∑≥

The ambassador inculpated Mariani with the grand vizier, and an Ottoman and

French o≈cial were sent to Cairo where Mariani was consul, ‘‘and they had him

hung by the neck with [a] letter attached to his feet.’’ Sanderson expands on the

event: ‘‘He hanged by the necke in his redd velvett goune under the chiefeste gate

of Cairo; beinge privat ly by force fetched out of his house in the eveninge, for

otherwise his death had bine prevented, he had so besotted and was so beloved of

most in the citie.’’ According to Sanderson, the Moors especially favored ‘‘Mallem

Paulo (Master Paul), as they commonly called him.’’∑∂

The cases of Mariani, Mehmed Querini, Venier, and Locadello demonstrate

the elites’ ability to redeﬁne and refashion themselves, even though they domi-

nated Venice politically, socially, and economically and their individual and group

identities were therefore most tight ly intertwined with the state. While their

motivations for transgressing political and religious boundaries varied, in all of

these cases Venetian birthrights did not prevent association with English, French,

and even Ottoman competitors as circumstances permitted and dictated. These

men did not abandon their Venetian selves; rather, their identities were compli-

cated and supplemented by their individual metamorphoses.

th e m a g n i f ic a c om u n i t à

The community of the Latin-rite Christian subjects of the sultan— called Perots

after Pera, the name often used by Europeans for Galata—was technically outside

of the Venetian domain, yet it was closely a≈liated with it. Because of its location

"
162,"142

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

in the interstices between the Muslim, Jewish, and Orthodox populations of Con-

stantinople, the Perot community sheds further light on the nature of communal

identity in the diverse world of the Mediterranean.

During the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II was eager to spare

Galata in order to protect the city’s commercial life, which he regarded as ‘‘vitally

important for the reconstruction of his new capital and the economy of his em-

pire.’’ So supportive of the merchants of Galata was Mehmed that he ordered his

ﬂeet to intervene in Chios on behalf of one of their most inﬂuential representa-

tives, Francesco Draperio, who owned alum mines there and was owed a signiﬁ-

cant sum by the Christian Chiots.∑∑ While many Genoese ﬂed Galata both before

and after its fall, a core group remained and was organized into what was known

as the Magniﬁca Comunità. This community was led by a council of twelve

o≈cials who replaced the preconquest o≈ce of the Genoese podesta and met

regularly in the church of San Francesco. The Magniﬁca Comunità was granted

certain legal and ceremonial rights, the most important of which was authority

over the a√airs of the remaining Latin churches in greater Constantinople. Un-

like the other much larger minority ta’ifa or millets o≈cially recognized by the

Ottomans, such as the Greeks, Jews, or Armenians, the Magniﬁca Comunità was

direct ly under the political jurisdiction of the kadı and voyvoda of Galata and did

not enjoy administrative, legal or political autonomy. Its members were dhimmi

subjects of the sultan, and not harbi, or non-Muslim foreigners, like the Frankish

merchants with whom they lived and dealt.∑∏

Early modern Constantinople’s Latin-rite Christians were not numerous: in

1580 a papal legate reported there were ﬁve hundred Roman Catholic subjects of

the sultans in Galata. They were joined by two thousand slaves, ﬁve hundred freed

slaves, and seven hundred merchants and embassy sta√ temporarily in the city. A

1600 report estimated there were only between seventeen and twenty-eight Perot

families, and a slight ly later report added 150 Protestants to the city’s Chris-

tian population.∑π Other contemporary reports generally support these ﬁgures.∑∫

These few families represented the last vestiges of the Genoese community that

had thrived in the area for centuries, joined by refugees from Ka√a forced to move

to the Ottoman capital after the capture of the Black Sea port in 1475. For the most

part the Perots lived in the center of Galata, near the great tower that had been the

heart of the city in Genoese times, though in the sixteenth century some of the

most successful and important members of the community joined the exodus to

the Vigne di Pera suburb outside Galata, neighboring the several European em-

bassies that were located there.∑Ω

Because of its small numbers, the Latin-rite community had to struggle con-

"
163,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

143

tinuously to retain its separate identity and avoid being assimilated into the larger

Greek Orthodox or Muslim populations. Della Valle reported, for example, that

the Perots observed the Latin rite, but in their ‘‘customs they are greekiﬁed

[ grecheggiano].’’ Visitors to Pera acknowledged the hyphenated character of Perot

identity, describing them as ‘‘Greeke Genoeses,’’ ‘‘Greeks, of Genoese origins,’’

and ‘‘Greek Franks.’’∏≠ This process of assimilation is found also in the language

of the community: while the Perots originally had spoken a Genoese variant of

Italian, by the seventeenth century Greek had replaced it as the everyday lan-

guage of the community, though Italian continued as its administrative idiom

and the lingua franca of the Levant, and many, most notably the dragomans, were

multilingual.∏∞

One way the Perots attempted to defend their identity was by avoiding mar-

riages with Orthodox Greeks. Indeed, in 1627 the Roman Catholic patriarchal

vicar of Constantinople tried to prohibit all intermarriage between Orthodox and

Catholic.∏≤ The records of the Venetian chancellery, however, provide ample evi-

dence that these marriages did occur often. Edoardo Gagliano married a daughter

to a Greek noble, as did the dragoman Ambrosio Grillo.∏≥ Another external ex-

pression and defense of identity was the Perots’ dress. Travelers to Constanti-

nople often commented on the distinctive costume of the Perots, who wore ‘‘high

collars, capped with calpaks [a characteristic black wool or felt cap worn in Tur-

key], with Ragusan bonnets and Mantuan hats,’’ which made them readily identi-

ﬁable within the cosmopolitan milieu of Galata.∏∂ Another means of defending

their community’s identity was through education; the Perots aggressively sought

Jesuit and other teachers for their children, ‘‘so that no rapacious wolf enters in

among us, or rather our children, who with bites of false doctrine might come and

poison these poor souls.’’∏∑ Their objective was simple: to defend their children’s

sense of cultural and religious identity as a small minority in the larger Muslim

and Orthodox cultures of Constantinople. Despite these e√orts, many Perots

gradually assimilated into broader Ottoman society. Ma≈o Venier estimated in

1582 that the Magniﬁca Comunità had lost four hundred Latin-rite households to

the Orthodox alone, and the community’s numbers continued to decrease.∏∏

Religion was a central element of the Perots’ identity; they maintained their

religious distinctiveness chieﬂy through the control and perpetuation of their

community’s sacred ediﬁces and rituals. As the last vestiges of the Latin-rite

community in the Ottoman capital, the Perots ardent ly defended their right to

govern the city’s Roman Catholic confraternities, hospitals, and monasteries, as

well as its ritual life of processions and holy feasts. Most important, however, was

the control of the community’s churches. In 1600 there were twelve Latin-rite

"
164,"144

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

churches in greater Constantinople, though most had only a few religious left

inhabiting them, and several were abandoned except for the occasional, excep-

tional mass. Situated in the heart of Galata, in the old Genoese quarter, the church

of San Francesco, with its monastery and nine friars, represented the geographi-

cal and spiritual focal point of the Latin-rite community in Constantinople. Also

important was San Benedetto, built in 1420 by the Genoese, which had a library

of 10,593 works.∏π The Magniﬁca Comunità took very seriously its protectorate

role; as one church o≈cial reported, the Perots had ‘‘an incredible zeal for the

Latin-rite.’’∏∫

The Perots’ zeal to superintend their churches often resulted in controversy

with religious representatives sent from Rome, as well as with the resident Ro-

man Catholic ambassadors who patronized and protected the churches. The fun-

damental issue centered on the question of who had legal authority over the

churches. Despite its strong identiﬁcation with the Roman church, the Magniﬁca

Comunità traced its sovereignty over the Ottoman capital’s Latin-rite churches to

Mehmed II. As Cristoforo Valier reported, the Perots claimed ‘‘absolute dominion

over all the churches of Pera, donated, as was seen in their statutes, by Emperor

Sultan Mehmet . . . to whom the Perots made voluntary submission of themselves

in return for the privileges and other immunities that they still enjoy today.’’∏Ω

This claim was contested both by Venice and Rome who heavily subsidized the

churches and the community. As a Roman o≈cial wrote to the bailo in 1590, ‘‘You

will do well not to give any authority here to the Perots over these places, nor over

the monks, because unfortunately they usurp the authority of the Religious, and

of the monasteries, to their damage.’’π≠

Disputes over the jurisdiction of the churches were common and often bitter,

and the patriarchal vicar assigned by Rome to oversee the churches had regularly

to threaten the priors of the Magniﬁca Comunità with excommunication because

of their refusal ‘‘to give account of their administration’’; indeed, in 1643 the

community was cut o√, though only temporarily.π∞ In an e√ort to take control of

the situation, in 1622 Rome decided to replace the patriarchal vicar with a bishop,

a move the Perots opposed great ly, fearing that a bishop would make a stronger

adversary in the struggle to control their churches.π≤ These machinations should

not mask the fact that in the end both the Perots and Rome depended great ly on

each other and strived to work together. The Perots claimed sovereignty over the

churches of Constantinople, but in practice they were not ﬁnancially or politically

capable of maintaining them and thus were dependent on subventions from

European powers and popes. For example, in 1603 the Venetian Senate voted to

grant the Perots thousands of ducats to cover the costs of maintenance and

"
165,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

145

restoration of the community’s churches, which were in a terrible state. Con-

versely, Venice relied on the community for a variety of religious, commercial,

and linguistic services. The papacy was dependent on the Magniﬁca Comunità to

maintain a Roman Catholic presence in the Ottoman capital so as to protect the

rights of believers throughout the sultan’s lands, as no papal representative was

sanctioned to reside or treat in the Porte.π≥

This interdependence meant that the Venetian nation and the Magniﬁca Com-

unità generally tried to maintain good relations. Perots regularly functioned as

Venice’s dragomans and in other o≈cial capacities within the embassy; from at

least 1550 on, the majority of the dragomans and giovani della lingua were Latin-

rite Ottoman subjects, and these lucrative posts were highly coveted within the

community. Part of their allure was that dragomans and other dependents of

foreign embassies were exempted from paying the two Ottoman taxes required of

dhimmi: the harac and the cizye. Dependents also had recourse to the Venetian

embassy’s legal and notarial institutions and thus were able to avoid tangling with

Ottoman courts and o≈cials if they desired.π∂

While they were almost always constrained to depend on Ottoman dragomans,

the baili clearly considered the Perots to be Ottomans and thus outside the Vene-

tian nation, despite their shared religion. When possible, the baili always pre-

ferred Venetian citizens as dragomans and o≈cials over ‘‘Perots and other na-

tions distant from the Chancellery.’’π∑ The obligation to rely on Perots in sensitive

positions was a continuous, bitter lament of the baili. Lorenzo Bernardo warned

in his relazione of the danger in having to rely on ‘‘Turkish subjects’’ like the

Perots in treating delicate matters of state. Indeed, the problems with one Perot

dragoman, Matheca Salvago, became so serious that the Council of Ten seriously

considered having him poisoned. The giovani della lingua language-training pro-

gram arose in response to this undesirable reliance.π∏ The motivations for this

lack of conﬁdence seem clear: Perots lived in the interstices of Ottoman and

European society or, as one scholar has described, ‘‘astride [the world] of the

‘Franks’ and that of the Ottoman ‘minorities.’ ’’ππ Like the Marranos, the Perots

were di≈cult to pin down; they were neither ﬁsh nor fowl, but rather men and

women with unique, seemingly contradictory identities that permitted them to

move comfortably between the various political and religious spheres of the early

modern Mediterranean world.

This evasiveness was evident in the community’s dealings with Venice on

matters of religion. During the sixteenth century, Venice had been the protector

and patron of the Magniﬁca Comunità and its churches; after 1608 the Perots

transferred this role increasingly to the French ambassadors, whom the Perots

"
166,"146

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

eventually declared their protecteur generale.π∫ They switched their allegiances to

France part ly because of a sense of Venice’s creeping commercial and political

decline in the Porte and part ly for religious motivations. The French were the

patrons of the Jesuits in Constantinople, and after a ﬁrst attempt to initiate a

mission failed when all the fathers died of the plague in 1583, the Jesuits were able

to establish a presence in Constantinople in 1609. The Magniﬁca Comunità,

supported by the French ambassador Salignac, had been very vocal in petitioning

the papacy to send the Jesuits, in part because they wanted them to establish a

school in Galata but also to wean the community from dependence on the other

orders, which were supported by Venice.πΩ Because the baili vigorously opposed

the Jesuit presence, a rift arose with the Perots, causing the baili to lament their

‘‘ancient devotion to this house that they are [now] alienating.’’ So inﬂuential did

the Jesuits become that they were the only order that attracted any Perot youth,

which forced the other religious orders to import religious to sta√ their facilities.∫≠

Commercial concerns also a√ected the Perots’ relations with European pow-

ers. In 1608, for example, Ottaviano Bon obtained permission for Venetian mer-

chants to open botteghe in the Bedestan of Galata. This move was vigorously

opposed by Constantinople’s Jewish merchants, who enlisted the opposition of

the Perots as well. Both were keen to defend their advantage as Ottoman subjects

in this crucial commercial venue, which served as a procurement center for

clothing for the Ottoman military. To protect their stake in this lucrative market

against Venetian merchants, the Jews and Perots did not hesitate to utilize con-

nections with Ottoman o≈cials and institutions, and to emphasize their status as

Ottoman subjects, to achieve their aims.∫∞

The Magniﬁca Comunità clearly represents a litt le-studied community situ-

ated in the interstices between the various polities and cultures of the eastern

Mediterranean. Culturally and religiously they imagined themselves as linked to

the broader community of European Christians in Constantinople, but this close

relationship did not mean that the Perots did not consider themselves Ottoman

subjects or beneﬁt from that status. They regularly migrated between the legal

institutions of Venice, the Ottomans, and the other European powers in Con-

stantinople as circumstances dictated. Many Perots’ sense of identity was clearly a

composite of their status as Ottoman subjects, their historical and cultural iden-

tity as Genoese Italians, their vocations as Venetian functionaries and depen-

dents, and their religious identity as a Roman Catholic minority. It is impossible

and unnecessary to rank these elements; the Perots emphasized them instrumen-

tally in the diverse ways they adapted and refashioned themselves within their

unique situation.

The case of the Piron (Perone) family of Pera illuminates the protean nature of

Perot identity. The four families of the Casa Piron were the largest of the twenty or

so clans that made up the core of the Perot community. The Piron may have had

some claim to nobility, though how well founded a claim is unclear.∫≤ We know

litt le of the history of the family, where its members originated, or when they

sett led in Galata. They were certainly among the wealthiest members of the

community: in 1590 the fourteen chief Perot families donated 400,000 akçe to

prevent the church of San Francesco from being made into a mosque, and almost

20 percent of this sum, 75,000 akçe, was paid by Niccolò and Stefano Piron alone.

The Piron were involved commercially in cloth, hides, and slaves, and in the early

part of the seventeenth century they owned a ship that traveled between Con-

stantinople and Venice. They had extensive commercial relationships with the

French, English, and imperial ambassadors, important merchants from the vari-

ous European trading nations, and many inﬂuential Ottoman-Muslim merchants

and o≈cials.∫≥ The Piron also served in responsible and inﬂuential positions in

the Magniﬁca Comunità as ‘‘elders of Pera’’ and owned valuable land in Galata

and the Vigne di Pera.∫∂

Despite, or perhaps as a result of, their importance in the Ottoman Latin-rite

community, the Piron were also actively involved with the Venetian nation. Al-

though never recognized as members of the nation, several di√erent family mem-

bers appear repeatedly in the rosters of the Council of Twelve, and one, Matteo

Piron, appears regularly from 1607 to 1635.∫∑ Clearly the Piron were respected and

inﬂuential members of the nation: in 1616, Matteo and Stefano Piron called a

meeting of the council to recommend one of their giovani as an o≈cial cernitor of

the nation, and their motion was approved. The Piron also loaned the baili large

amounts of cash when the duties collected were insu≈cient to cover consular

costs. Though widely and openly recognized as Perot subjects of the sultan,

Matteo and Stefano Piron appear at the head of a 1619 list of ‘‘Venetian mer-

chants’’ ordered to pay their cottimi; Stefano and two other Piron merchants also

appear on a list of Venetian ‘‘merchants’’ and ‘‘subjects’’ in 1616. Antonio Piron

also played, at the request of the bailo, a role in an o≈cial investigation into serious

allegations against the Venetian cittadino originario, dragoman and coadiutore to

Marco Venier, Girolamo Alberti.∫∏

As was the case with Edoardo Gagliano, the Piron also pursued marriage

alliances to align themselves closely with the Venetian nation. Piron women often

married Venetian dragomans: the inﬂuential Venetian grand dragoman, Marcan-

tonio Borisi, married Caterina Piron, and had to obtain a dispensation to do so

through the o≈ces of the bailo, after the death of his ﬁrst wife, Caterina’s cousin.

"
168,"148

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

The bailo intervened in this matter to ensure that his most important dragoman

would not ‘‘be linked to other households.’’∫π In the 1630s a Piron became a

Venetian dragoman, and several others acquired lucrative positions as giovani

della lingua. One Piron boy beneﬁted from the patronage of ‘‘several most excel-

lent senators,’’ including a number of former baili, among them Matteo Zane,

who became patriarch of Venice and patronized the lad’s study in the seminary of

the Somascans in the lagoon.∫∫ Clearly ties of patronage and marriage with Venice

were an important part of the Casa Piron’s strategy, yet they also jealously guarded

their Ottoman identity. When an inheritance matter that had been entrusted to

the bailo’s adjudication was not resolved to their satisfaction, family members did

not hesitate to take the matter before the kadı of Galata.∫Ω

The Piron moved with ease between the various religious, cultural and politi-

cal poles of Galata, using instrumentally their relationships with Venice, the

Ottoman Empire, and other entities to advance their family’s fortunes and posi-

tion. Their eight hundred botte ship, for example, though of foreign construction,

was recognized by the V Savii as one of the twenty-six Venetian ships trading

legitimately in the Mediterranean, which allowed Venetian merchants to ship

goods on it. The Piron also used it and other ships to ferry Venetian soldiers and

slaves in the Levant. In one instance, the bailo removed the accreditation of a

Jewish broker who had cheated Antonio Piron of some catt le hides that Piron had

purchased from a Muslim merchant.Ω≠ In another case, when some six thousand

ducats of their goods were held as suspected contraband in Zante by a Venetian

o≈cial, Niccolò and Antonio Piron asked Marco Venier to assist them in freeing

it, which he did willingly, even though an inquiry produced evidence that the

goods were indeed illegal. Venier’s reasons are revealing: though Ottoman sub-

jects, the Piron had assisted the imprisoned bailo Marcantonio Barbaro in the past

war at great risk to their lives and fortunes, ‘‘employing themselves as if they were

vassals of the Most Serene Republic.’’ They were still ‘‘most loyal,’’ Venier reports,

and informed Venice’s representatives on the Ottoman ﬂeet’s movements and

other sensitive a√airs in the Porte. Another motivation Venier cites for nurturing

this relationship was the extensive network of the Piron family. They were in great

favor with important o≈cials in the divan, including the vizier, the sultan, and his

mother (the Piron had been responsible for bringing Muhammed III to the

capital when his father died). Antonio was an intimate of Ferrat Pa ¸sa and many

other ‘‘principal Turks [were] his friends.’’ The Piron wives, too, ‘‘practiced famil-

iarly’’ in the households of inﬂuential Ottomans, rounding out the network of

Piron connections within the Ottoman hierarchy.Ω∞

Because of the breadth of their relations and their reputation, the Piron often

"
169,"m e r c h a n t s , p a t r i c i a n s , c i t i z e n s

149

bridged the Ottoman and Venetian worlds. Antonio Piron was elected by the kadı

of Galata to resolve the matter of a failed Venetian merchant, and his selection

was accepted by the Venetian nation. Zorzi Piron was chosen by an Ottoman-

Muslim merchant to resolve a dispute he had with two prominent Venetian

merchants; all parties agreed Piron was a dependable and honest broker and that

they would abide by his ruling. In another instance, an inﬂuential Ottoman

o≈cial employed Antonio Piron, ‘‘his friend,’’ to act in a ﬁduciary role in resolving

an issue between him and a Venetian merchant.Ω≤ The Piron existed comfortably

in the liminal space in which the Ottoman, Venetian, Genoese, Muslim, Ortho-

dox, and Christian ambits intersected. They seem to have been perfect ly at ease

navigating these seemingly incompatible realms and to have perceived no contra-

diction in their composite identity of Ottoman subjects, Latin-rite Christians, and

Venetian allies.Ω≥

While it is di≈cult to make broad generalizations about early modern identity,

the adaptability and multivalency of identity exhibited by the Jews and renegades

of the previous chapter was not limited to the margins of society. Patricians

and cittadini originari, despite their privileged status, still transgressed political

and religious boundaries, albeit less frequent ly than subjects with their more

ephemeral and less direct relationship to the ruling class and its institutions.

In doing so they added layers to their sense of self rather than substituting an

old identity for a new. As new Muslims they embraced a new Ottoman political

and religious identity; at the same time they preserved their memory and identity

as members of the ruling classes of Venice and their sense of belonging to a

speciﬁc family.

The unique community of Latin-rite Christians in Constantinople, the Perots,

further demonstrate how seemingly incongruous and even conﬂictual pieces can

combine into an intricate mosaic of individual identity. In many ways this small

group felt threatened with assimilation into the much larger Greek and Muslim

society with which it coexisted. Its members achieved self-deﬁnition and preserva-

tion of communal boundaries through dress, marriage strategies, and education.

The role of the Magniﬁca Comunità as sole representative and defender of the

Roman church in the Ottoman capital was central to this identity, yet the Perots’

sense of purpose derived as much from their status as subjects of the sultan as it

did from the Christianity. In the conﬂicts that arose with the French, Venetians,

and even the papacy over the administration and control of the churches, the

Perots made much more of their status as Ottomans and the legal right to control

their churches granted them by Mehmed II than they did of their religious iden-

"
170,"150

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

tity. By the same token, when Ottoman o≈cials threatened their churches with

closure, the Perots did not hesitate to refashion, or better, reorder their collective

identity as they sought the intervention and protection of these same Christian

adversaries. For the Perots, Roman Catholic and Ottoman identities were comple-

mentary, rather than mutually exclusive categories.

An Urban Middle Ground

Venetians and Ottomans in Constantinople

Cultural confrontation, what Samuel Huntington has called the ‘‘clash of civili-

zations,’’∞ has fascinated historians from the earliest days of Herodotus’s History

of the Persian Wars. Tales of human conﬂicts have seemed more compelling, and

perhaps more representative of the human condition, than have tales of coopera-

tion. This has certainly been true in the historiography of the engagement of

Islam and Christianity and, more narrowly, that of the Venetian and Ottoman

empires, which has privileged discussions of war almost always over peace. Con-

ﬂict and misunderstanding have certainly informed this relationship; however, an

overemphasis on these factors obscures the striking, unanticipated fact that for

the majority of their shared history, coexistence as much as conﬂict characterized

Veneto-Ottoman relations. Volumes have been devoted to the history of conﬂict,

but the moments and mechanisms of coexistence have been largely overlooked.

In recent years historians have begun to reconsider the nature of the inter-

section of cultures in more nuanced and sophisticated ways that avoid reducing

cultural interaction to an encounter between oppositional metacategories such as

East and West, Christian and Muslim, and instead recognize its inherent ly messy,

contradictory, and variable nature. In the context of the early modern Mediter-

ranean, a few scholars have tried to move beyond broad, geopolitical general-

izations, focusing on local and regional contexts that suggest the complexity

and ambiguity of relations between people of diverse religious, political, social,

and cultural backgrounds.≤ The binary certainties of the past, in which the early

modern Mediterranean ‘‘was composed of isolated blocks, secure and content in

their foreignness,’’≥ have been convincingly undercut, and a more variegated and

"
172,"152

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

equivocal understanding of Mediterranean culture in this time has emerged. This

sophisticated analysis of identity and cultural exchanges has produced a more

subt le and nuanced portrait of the real rather than the rhetorical nature of every-

day existence and of the ways that potentially discordant individuals and groups

were able to live in close proximity and in relative harmony.

One of the keys to this accommodation was the often ﬂuid and functional

nature of identity among early modern peoples, their ability to accept inconsis-

tency and discontinuity in ways that may seem confusing or impossible in a world

such as ours in which rigid religious, racial, sexual, and political boundaries are

often conjured. However, it seems clear that instead of imagining the early mod-

ern Mediterranean in our modern image, inspired by the primacy of the nation-

state paradigm, we would do better to view this age as a shared world of soft

boundaries,∂ of porous frontiers inhabited by culturally, politically and religiously

diverse groups who struggled to be sure, but often succeeded in living together as

neighbors in relative tranquility.

Three general areas serve to illustrate the character of the peaceful relations

between Venetians and Ottomans in early modern Constantinople— geography,

economy, and sociability. A detailed study of each reveals that Venetians and

Ottomans did not exist in isolation from each other but in fact had regular and

meaningful interactions across a wide spectrum. These relations were similar to

those of most complex societies: at times they were characterized by cooperation,

support, and even amity, at times by controversy and disagreement. While we

cannot ignore the ample evidence of antagonism and discord that have informed

past discussions of the early modern Mediterranean, a more complete under-

standing of relations between religious and cultural groups in this age must

also make room for the very compelling evidence of regular, recurring ‘‘cordial

interaction.’’∑

g e o g r a ph y

Greater Constantinople— comprising the capital, Galata, Eyup, and Üsküdar

(formerly Scutari)∏—was an immense, diverse metropolis that drew people from

all over the Mediterranean, Near East, and Europe. The beauty and allure of the

seat of the sultans were part of the draw, but most attractive were the many

opportunities that it promised. The city itself was huge: Thomas Sherley thought

it ‘‘the greatest citye that euer I sawe.’’π He was certainly right: contempora-

ries hazarded wild guesses at Constantinople’s size, ranging from 600,000 to

"
173,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

153

1,231,207.∫ Modern historians estimate the city’s population was from 300,000 to

500,000.Ω Whatever its actual size, Constantinople was without peer: it was the

largest city in the Mediterranean, Europe, or the Near East.

Behind these population ﬁgures lay an extremely diverse community. A 1535

survey found the city divided into 46,635 Muslim, 25,292 Christian, and 8,070

Jewish households. Similarly, a 1550 census found that the total population was

approximately 400,000, composed of 40,000 Christian houses, 4,000 Jewish,

and 60,000 Muslim. In both of these surveys the population was approximately

58 percent Muslim and 42 percent non-Muslim.∞≠

Constantinople’s mixed character would seem to suggest that the city func-

tioned as something of cultural middle ground in which communal and individ-

ual boundaries were softer and more porous. In fact, scholars have argued quite

the opposite, positing an image of geographical isolationism in which individuals

and groups rarely mixed, or even crossed paths, living instead in separation, both

self-imposed and mandated by their rulers. Seen in this fashion, Constantinople

conformed to the model ‘‘Oriental city,’’ composed of ‘‘an array of closed and

compact societies, each leading lives separate from the other.’’∞∞ For Braude and

Lewis, the Ottoman Empire represents a classical plural society in which ‘‘the

medley of peoples’’ inhabits the same geographical space but never combines,

living ‘‘side by side, but separately.’’ In this segregated setting, ‘‘each group holds

its own religion, its own culture and language, its own ideas and ways.’’∞≤ Robert

Mantran similarly describes Constantinople’s population as concurrent ly mixed

and separated: minorities grouped around a church or synagogue in ‘‘isolated

cores amidst the Turkish masses.’’∞≥

In Constantinople, this proximate isolation was expressed spatially in the sepa-

ration between Constantinople and Galata, the suburb facing the capital from

across the Golden Horn. Despite its propinquity, Galata historically had been

quite distinct from its much larger neighbor. No bridges connected the two cities

until the nineteenth century, so crossings were made in one of the ﬁfteen to six-

teen thousand small boats ( perme) that plied the waters of the Golden Horn. This

expanse of sea symbolized and accentuated the ﬁssure between the two cities.∞∂

Prior to 1453, Galata was home to the sizable and largely independent Genoese

merchant community. After his conquest of the Byzantine capital, Mehmed II left

the suburb relatively untouched so as not to interrupt its commerce, but he did

incorporate it entirely into the larger metropolitan institutional structures of his

new capital. The area became something of a ghetto for most of the capital’s non-

Ottomans, who gradually relocated there. The Venetian community in Byzantine

"
174,"154

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

times had been located within Constantinople proper, but following the Ottoman

conquest, despite Venetian attempts to regain their old quarter, the community

and the bailo’s house were removed to Galata.∞∑

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many travelers commented on

what they perceived as the European, or ‘‘Frankish,’’ character of Galata, or Pera.

George Sandys reported ‘‘Pera hath three Christians for one Mahometan: for no

Jew dwells in Pera, though they have their ﬂops there.’’ Pigafetta challenged this

last assertion, but generally agreed with Sandys: ‘‘Most of the inhabitants are

Greeks, then Venetians, French, a few Turks and very many Jews . . . Here, in sum,

one appears to be in a city of Italy.’’ Nicolay acknowledged that there were Muslims

in Galata but described the city as being divided by three walls, which separated

the Greeks from the Muslims and from the ‘‘Peratins.’’∞∏ Ottomans too considered

Galata as ‘‘part of Frengistan or Europe’’; indeed, for Ottoman-Muslims, Galata

represented the morally dangerous other to Istanbul. For writers from the sultan

Mehmed II to the famed seventeenth-century traveler Evliya Çelebi, Galata was

the city of the Franks and as such symbolized ‘‘vice and depravity.’’∞π

This geographical separation, according to an earlier generation of scholars,

had broader social implications. Mantran argues that as a result of the demo-

graphic engineering of the sultans, Galata became the ‘‘City of the Inﬁdels’’

facing the ‘‘City of the Ottomans.’’ By 1650, it had e√ectively become a ‘‘Euro-

pean residential city,’’ with an insigniﬁcant Muslim minority of several hundred.

Not only did a meager number of Muslims inhabit Galata, but those who did

rarely mixed with the Franks, who in turn ‘‘were not . . . in contact with the Turks.’’

In the Vigne di Pera suburb of Galata where their embassies were located, Euro-

peans were even more completely insulated from contact with ‘‘Turks.’’ For Man-

tran, this situation resulted in a minimum of xenophobia and interreligious

strife in Constantinople, as there were so few actual encounters between Franks

and Turks.∞∫

There is increasing evidence that this clean division between Muslim Con-

stantinople and inﬁdel Galata, and the simplistic vision of cultural encounters

and interaction it suggests, has been seriously overstated. The view that Mus-

lims were forbidden to sett le in Galata is based on the misinterpretation of the
ahidname granted by Mehmed II to the Genoese in Galata in 1453. As ˙Inalcık has

shown, the passage ‘‘no doghandjı or kul shall come and stay as guests in their

households’’ was a common stipulation in Ottoman grants that guaranteed no

military men would be quartered in private houses.∞Ω It did not imply that Mus-

lims were forbidden to sett le in the city, and there is ample proof that many did.≤≠

As Galata grew after the Ottoman conquest, it came to be peopled by as wide a

"
175,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

155

spectrum of people as Constantinople. One traveler’s observation suggests the

cosmopolitan face of the city: ‘‘The natural inhabitants of this city are Greeks,

Turks and Jews; inﬁnite then the other men of other various and distant nations

who are living here.’’ These included Spanish, Italians, Germans, Russians, En-

glish, French, Dutch, and even men from far away Peru.≤∞

Beyond travelers’ anecdotes, the multicultural, and increasingly Muslim, face

of Galata appears clearly in Ottoman documents. Indeed, sett ling Muslims in

Galata was a deliberate part of the sultans’ demographic policies: Süleyman estab-

lished a community of Egyptians in Galata, and waves of Moor and Morisco

refugees from Granada sett led in the city in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-

turies.≤≤ A survey of 1455 shows that within two years of the conquest of Con-

stantinople, a Muslim quarter had been established near the Tower of Galata. A

document of 1477– 78 reports that Galata was inhabited by 535 Muslim, 592

Greek, 332 Frank, and 62 Armenian households.≤≥ Kasımpa ¸sa, the main arsenal

of the empire; the cannon foundry at Tophane; and the Acemio ˘glan school of

Galata Sarayı were all products of Mehmed II’s resett lement e√orts, and they

attracted increasing numbers of Muslims. There were also numerous Ottoman

o≈cials and their subalterns in the city, as well as a group of ﬁve to six hundred

soldiers responsible for maintaining the peace. By 1500, despite its physical sepa-

ration, Galata ceased to be a distinct entity but was fully assimilated into the

broader, Ottoman, Muslim capital complex of cities and suburbs. By 1600, Otto-

man Galata had a Muslim majority, and by 1700, there were only six non-Muslim

churches, as opposed to twelve mosques, in the city.≤∂

Contemporary observers noted the evolving Muslim character of Galata. Gio-

vanni Moro in 1590 reported that while Galata was previously inhabited only by

Christians, ‘‘at present, because the city of Constantinople is not su≈cient for the

great concourse of Turks, the long tract of marina [Kasımpa ¸sa] . . . is occupied for

the most part by’’ Ottoman-Muslims. A few years later, della Valle indicated that

Galata had grown ‘‘particularly with a great number of Turks,’’ and an ecclesiasti-

cal report of 1625 indicated that its inhabitants were ‘‘for the most part foreigners

of diverse nations, though the Turks, who hold the government of it, inhabit the

greater part.’’≤∑ Far from being an inﬁdel ghetto, then, Galata was a place of en-

counter and engagement at the heart of the diverse population of Constantinople.

Exact demographic ﬁgures for Galata are di≈cult to establish with precision.

Certainly Evliya Çelebi’s estimate of 200,000 inﬁdels and 64,000 Muslims is

highly inﬂated. More reﬂective of the city’s makeup perhaps, is his report that by

the mid-seventeenth century, Galata had ninety-three neighborhoods— seventy

Greek, seventeen Muslim, three European, two Armenian, and one Jewish. Ac-

"
176,"156

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

cording to Stoianovich, a typical neighborhood (mahalle) contained an average

of forty houses, with approximately seven people per house, which translates

to a population of perhaps 26,000. Mantran’s estimate is higher: he estimates

Galata’s population as approximately one-tenth of Constantinople’s, for a total of

perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 people.≤∏

There was no agreement on the number of non-Ottomans and Ottoman-

Catholics in Galata: in 1581 Pietro Cedulini counted 500 free Ottoman-Catholic

subjects, 500 freed slaves (libertini ), 5–600 foreigners passing through, and 100

persons attached to embassies. In addition, he estimated that there were 6– 7,000

slaves in the arsenal and port. A 1616 Ottoman census of all Europeans revealed

approximately 1,000 resident in Galata, and a report from 1626 indicated that the

remaining families of Genoese extraction totaled 43 casate comprising 55 fami-

lies, or 550 people, as well as perhaps 500 libertini, and an unknown number

of slaves.≤π Galata’s Jewish population too increased steadily in the period after

Lepanto: a tax register of 1690 listed 1,033 Jews in Galata who paid the poll tax,

second in number only to the Jews in Constantinople proper, as well as a small

group in the Vigne di Pera.≤∫

While people of all religious and cultural backgrounds lived throughout the

city, they did tend to congregate around geographical poles. The most important

Perot concentration was near the Galata Tower, which had been formerly the

aristocratic center of the Genoese community. The old center of the city was also

the focus of the growing Jewish population. Lagiro was inhabited predominant ly

by Greeks, in the area where four Greek churches still exist. Azapkapı, to the west,

was most ly Muslim, with a Dominican church converted into a mosque there.

The Muslim inhabitants of Galata generally grouped together to the west of the

Galata Tower, particularly in the area of Kasımpa ¸sa, as many Muslims worked in

the naval yards. There was also a Christian population in this area, grouped

around the church of St. Demetrios.≤Ω

The city’s divisions into religious and ethnic neighborhoods might suggest

that the urban fabric of Constantinople included diverse groups living in prox-

imity but ultimately separated from each other. However, the city had a more

multifarious complexion in which boundaries were dynamic and often over-

lapped. Hints of this more varied urban, cultural geography emerge from scat-

tered documents found in the notarial records of the Venetian chancellery, which

register land transactions involving members of the nation but also the larger

community of Galata. These records are not su≈cient for mapping the eth-

noreligious geography of Galata, or for constructing any concrete statistical pic-

ture; however, they contain data indicating that while neighborhoods might have

"
177,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

157

had a predominant religious or ethnic makeup, such did not preclude people of

diverse religious and cultural backgrounds living in close proximity.

The widowed Perot, Isabetta di Battista Salvaressa, for example, owned a house

near the Porta del Cula that bordered on properties belonging to two Ottoman-

Muslims. The Venetian dragoman Tommaso Navon inherited a house near

Galata Sarayı, which was also near the house of Edoardo Gagliano. Another

dragoman, Marcantonio Borisi, received as dowry a portion of a large house near

San Francesco, on the main city street next to the house of a Muslim. He also had

a summer house in the area of the seraglio to the east of a Muslim cemetery.≥≠ A

Venetian merchant who died in Galata held a long-term lease on a house that

belonged to a mosque, and a compatriot sold a house with two shops on the main

ﬂoor, a courtyard and a well, located next to several Muslim neighbors.≥∞

Religious property was not isolated either, as Borisi’s property near the Mus-

lim graveyard of Galata demonstrates. Some Muslims purchased Latin-rite eccle-

siastical property: a document in the Vatican dated 1653 mentions the sale of a

garden and a house on the edge of the church and convent of San Francesco,

which ‘‘were sold to a Turk friend of ours to pay a tax of 30,000 reals to the grand

vizier.’’ The church of San Pietro also had neighboring Muslims, including a

number of women.≥≤

Economic and social considerations, as much as religion, played a role in

residence location. This is particularly evident in the Vigne di Pera, even though

this area has often been described as a predominant ly Greek and Frank suburb.

Most foreign embassies were moved there from Galata in the sixteenth century,

and many merchants built luxurious stone houses in this desirable neighborhood

as well. But as in other villages along the Bosporus, wealthy Jews, Christians, and
Muslims lived next to each other.≥≥ The main road of Galata, now ˙Istiklal Caddesi,

was the axis of this tony suburb. Pigafetta reported that in Galata ‘‘at the top of the

hill beyond the walls and the prison tower there are many houses with large

gardens, both of Turks and of Greeks.’’ The French embassy, and by 1620 the

Dutch embassy, was also located close by.≥∂ In this same area were located a

mosque (the former church of St. Catherine), across from the public baths, and

the Galata Sarayı, where the pages of the sultans were trained. The earliest con-

vent of the Mevlevi dervishes, founded in 1492, was also located in this area.≥∑

Along this same main street, direct ly next to the French embassy, was the

bailate of Venice.≥∏ Venetian documents record numerous Muslim neighbors of

the baili. A renegade Muslim ship captain from Sebenico had a house imme-

diately adjacent, and a ‘‘Hagi Jusuf Abdulla, head of a team of Caulkers in the

arsenal,’’ purchased a plot of land between the Venetian and the French embas-

"
178,"158

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

sies.≥π Many other Muslims also inhabited the immediate area. The baili were

often on familiar terms with these neighbors and sometimes served as their

patrons. One Muslim neighbor who was hoping to be awarded an important

Ottoman o≈ce petitioned Marco Venier to intercede with the vizier on his behalf.

Venier did so and reported that ‘‘the pa¸sa indulged me very willingly.’’≥∫

Living in close proximity also produced occasional problems. The bailate had a

ceremonial portal that at some point in the sixteenth century had been bricked up

at the instigation of the house’s owner, the Venetian dragoman Matheca Salvago,

and some Muslim neighbors. When Marco Venier tried to have it reopened, a

group of ‘‘more than 2,000 Turks gathered from the streets and shops’’ and went

to the divan shouting ‘‘come Muslims to defend the cause of the religion against a

Giaur, who wants to overwhelm our houses,’’ calling ‘‘Allah, Allah’’ and throwing

their turbans to the ground. Venier collected testimonies from twenty neighbors

who were ‘‘a√ectionate to this house’’ and also the testimony of a former kadı of

Galata who was in favor of his initiative. With these he was able to obtain an

imperial promise to punish anyone who blocked the action, and the door was

One of the chief areas of cultural intercourse in Galata was commerce; how-

ever, as one historian recent ly observed, we know comparatively litt le about the

day-to-day nature of interactions between Ottoman and European merchants.∂≠

Rather than speciﬁc evidence, scholars have often relied on generalizations and

assumptions: one such foundational assumption has been that although sig-

niﬁcant trade occurred between European states and the Ottoman Empire, it did

not translate into tangible contacts between individual Muslims and Christians.

Rather, commerce was carried out by resident European merchants with Otto-

man minority populations—Greeks, Armenians, and especially Jews. A corollary

to this is the widespread belief that Muslim Ottomans did not travel outside dar al-

Isl ¯am to trade with inﬁdels.

The historical roots of the binary view of early modern Mediterranean com-

merce are deep. Among contemporary European travelers it was a common

assumption that ‘‘Turks’’ did not engage in trade direct ly, depending instead on

non-Muslim intermediaries. The English traveler Fynes Moryson, for example,

reported ‘‘all the precious tra≈ck of Turkey, by reason of the inhabitants slothful-

nesse, is in the hands of Jewes and of Christians, and was long in the sole hands of

the Venetians.’’ He continues: Turks ‘‘traded in Natolia, and other parts of their

"
179,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

159

owne Empire . . . but they take no voyage by sea into forraigne parts, excepting

some few that come to Venice . . . So as the Jewes, the Greeks subject to the Turks,

and other confederate Christians, exporting their commodities, they themselves

have very few ships.’’ The Scottish traveler William Lithgow observed in 1632,

‘‘The whole commerce of all commodities in Turkey is in the hands of Jewes and

Christians, . . . who so warily manage their business that they enjoyed the most

proﬁts of any trading there, disappointing the Turks owne subjects of their due

and ordinary traﬁcke.’’ A Venetian source states it more blunt ly: ‘‘Turks are not

merchants.’’∂∞

This picture of Mediterranean commerce permeates inﬂuential nineteenth

and early twentieth century works on the Ottoman Empire and Mediterranean

trade—Hammer, Iorga, Heyd— in part because of their reliance on travel narra-

tives. Heyd maintains, for example, that ‘‘Turks . . . had no taste for trade . . . but

rather [an] insatiable passion for conquest.’’∂≤ Gibb and Bowen’s Islamic Society

and the West similarly states, ‘‘The European trade was entirely in the hands of

Christians (European and Levantine) and Jews.’’∂≥ Mantran, too, subscribes to this

vision of Mediterranean commerce: he argues that Muslims found commerce

with non-Muslims ‘‘repugnant,’’ and thus avoided travel to trade outside the dar

al-Isl ¯am. Foreign, non-Muslim merchants did travel to Constantinople and other

Islamic ports, but they traded through intermediaries because doing business

with fellow Christians created a climate of comprehension that could never be

duplicated with Asiatic Muslims who had a di√erent language, religion, and cul-

ture.∂∂ This same view is evident in Bernard Lewis’s work: he argues, in language

clearly inspired by Mary Douglas’s Purity and Danger, that Ottoman-Muslims

attempted systematically to avoid what he calls the ‘‘dirty trades’’— banking, diplo-

macy, commerce, in short anything that involved ‘‘dealing with foreigners, [who

were] seen by strict Muslims as tainted and dangerous to the[ir] souls.’’ They

‘‘were preserved from contact and, as they saw it, contamination by a large class

of intermediaries’’ composed of non-Muslim subjects, manumitted slaves, refu-

gees, and renegades who ‘‘served as a cushion, or perhaps more precisely as an

insulation protecting the host Muslim society from the culture shock of European

impact.’’∂∑

Whether Ottoman-Muslim merchants ought to trade among inﬁdels was, of

course, also widely debated among medieval and early modern Muslim scholars.

Some forbade any commerce with the inﬁdel, who might use proﬁts to pursue

war against Islam. Others maintained that trade and travel to the West were

permissible only to get food in time of shortage. One school of thought held that

Muslims could travel outside dar al-Isl ¯am only to ransom Muslim captives. Other

"
180,"160

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Qur’anic scholars believed that it was acceptable to travel abroad for trade, as well

as to accept inﬁdels into Muslim lands for the same purpose.∂∏ Clearly there

existed no single attitude in the Islamic world toward trade with outsiders. One

reason Muslims were discouraged from venturing abroad was the intolerance,

amply demonstrated over one thousand years of shared history, of Christians for

Muslims. Another danger was that exposure to the tainting inﬂuence of the West

would induce conversions among peripatetic Muslims, something that did occur

often enough to warrant concern.∂π Interestingly, this same argument was used to

discourage young Christians from traveling to Muslim lands.

If the theological explanation for Muslim indi√erence to commerce with Chris-

tian Europe is not entirely convincing, some scholars have advanced an even more

problematic ethnocultural reading that depicts the ‘‘Turks’’ as warrior steppe peo-

ples who had no inclination to sea-travel or to trade. Thus, the powerful Ottoman

navy and merchant ﬂeet was manned not by Ottoman-Muslims, but by Greek

subjects more inclined to seafaring. The ‘‘Turks’’ wanted to make Constantinople

the economic center of the Mediterranean, but as steppe warriors with litt le

commercial acumen, they relied on minority subjects— Jews, Armenians—with a

strong background in trade.∂∫ A variant on this view acknowledges that some

European Muslims did trade in the dar al-Harb but implies that these newer

adherents to Islam were somehow less Muslim than their Asiatic co-religionists,

and thus more inclined to travel abroad.∂Ω

In recent years, however, this paradigm has been challenged by Ottomanists

who have expressed a ‘‘growing discomfort’’ with this ‘‘older school of thought.’’∑≠

Chief among these is Çemal Kafadar, who has argued that there is no evidence of

any action or law by Ottoman political or religious authorities aimed at preventing

Ottoman-Muslim merchants from trading with foreigners in or out of the em-

pire. On the contrary, he has found traces of signiﬁcant, long-term mercantile

operations involving Ottoman-Muslims trading outside dar al-Isl ¯am, which en-

joyed governmental and legal protection under Islamic law.∑∞ Other scholars have

echoed this position, showing the occasional presence of Muslim merchants in

Venice, for example, already in the fourteenth century, as well as extensive di-

rect commerce between Ottoman-Muslims and Genoese in the fourteenth and

ﬁfteenth centuries.∑≤ Persian Muslim merchants too have been shown to have

traded widely with non-Muslims both domestically and abroad.∑≥ Indeed, Maxime

Rodinson sees this regular commercial contact as an engine for expanding cul-

tural interaction and even comprehension. He has suggested that the increased

factual knowledge of Islam in the late medieval and early modern periods was

"
181,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

161

driven in good measure by the growth in commercial contacts and ‘‘the quest for

commercial proﬁt.’’∑∂

That early modern Ottoman-Muslims were extensively and direct ly involved in

face-to-face commerce with Venetian merchants throughout the Mediterranean

is amply, indeed exhaustively, borne out by Venetian sources.∑∑ These demon-

strate that Ottoman trade was one of the few sectors of Venice’s economy that

remained relatively immune to the commercial troubles that became apparent in

the late sixteenth century.∑∏ Appearances of Ottoman-Muslim merchants in the

chancellery protocols of the Venetian nation in Constantinople are so common as

to preclude a systematic consideration. While it is di≈cult to paint a comprehen-

sive picture of individual merchants and their trade networks, in part due to the

notational inconsistencies of Venetian secretaries and notaries, the experiences of

several merchants emerge quite clearly from the documentary record that show

the nature and extent of Veneto-Ottoman commercial contacts.∑π

One such merchant was Çelebi Mehmed Reis of Ankara. Mehmed maintained

a wide-ranging commercial network between Ankara, Constantinople, Venice,

and Candia: he dealt primarily in woolen and silk cloths, leather, foodstu√s, and

cash transfers.∑∫ He began shipping goods to Venice immediately following the

end of the War of the Holy League in 1573, and he may well have been involved in

trade prior to, and perhaps even during, the war when commerce was only par-

tially and temporarily interrupted.∑Ω His chief contact in Venice was Lorenzo

Girardi, one of the city’s most important merchants, whom he addressed in

letters as his ‘‘amico carissimo Signor Lorenzo.’’∏≠ Perhaps they had met in Venice

or Constantinople, though both generally traded through agents, often family

members. Mehmed usually sent his goods to Venice with several men, including

his brother-in-law, Yusuf Çelebi. He also retained a number of agents in Galata,

including Ottoman Jewish and Christian subjects.

Mehmed considered Girardi ‘‘a good and loyal man,’’ and he authorized

him to appear on his behalf before Venetian councils, and to trade in his name

without other intermediaries or o≈cial brokers. By circumventing the normal

channels of trade, Mehmed was obviously trying to avoid incurring additional

operating costs. To further protect his interests, he had an agent in Galata register

an o≈cial declaration in the Venetian chancellery and obtain a hüccet from the

kadı of Constantinople stating that Girardi owed him no money and was autho-

rized to buy and sell in his name. These documents were then sent to Venice to

legitimate Girardi’s status as Mehmed’s representative.∏∞ By utilizing both Vene-

tian and Ottoman channels, which was very common, Mehmed e√ectively nur-

"
182,"162

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

tured and protected his lucrative trade in the lagoon. By his own estimate, his

commerce annually brought more than two thousand ducats into Venice’s tax

co√ers.∏≤

At one point, Çelebi Mehmed Reis had to defend himself against Michel

Membrè, the dragoman of the Venetian chancellery, whom he claimed was over-

charging on the fees paid to him by all Ottoman merchants in Venice. Grievances

against Membrè were quite common: in 1587 a group of Muslim merchants and

brokers complained that Membrè’s monopoly of the dragoman’s o≈ce was detri-

mental to Veneto-Ottoman commerce because of ‘‘the great quantity of merchan-

dise belonging to these Turks that is conducted, purchased and sold, and which

each day grows larger.’’ They argued that more dragomans were needed to better

deal with this expanding market. Indeed, after Membrè’s death two men were

granted his o≈ce in response to the increased trade of Ottomans in Venice.∏≥

Another Ottoman-Muslim merchant trading in Venice was Resul A ˘ga, com-

mercially active from at least 1600 to 1620.∏∂ Resul A ˘ga traded on a larger scale

than Mehmed: by his own account, he sent annually between Venice and Con-

stantinople 550 bolts of camlets, 40 bales of silk, 200 bales of wax, as well as other

goods, in addition to 20,000 ducats in cash. These brought in more than 700

ducats to Venice at the special 2 percent customs rate that Ottoman merchants

enjoyed. In 1620 it was rumored that he had in Venice 8,000 ducats worth of

goods— including wool and silk cloths and paper— and specie.∏∑ He shipped these

goods by caravan from Constantinople to Spalato and then by ship to Venice,

where at various times he engaged Jewish, Venetian, and Muslim factors. Besides

this overland trade, he also regularly sent ships to Candia.∏∏ In 1620, Resul A ˘ga

and several other Ottoman merchants lost a ship to corsairs in the Adriatic; the

resultant controversy threatened the Veneto-Ottoman peace and ended in the

execution of Marcantonio Borisi, the Venetian grand dragoman. The situation

was resolved through diplomatic channels, and a ‘‘gift’’ of 3,700 ducats to Resul

A ˘ga, who quickly became deeply invested in Venetian commerce again, to the

point of lending 3,000 ducats to the bailo to cover the embassy’s expenses when

funds could not be raised from within the Venetian nation.∏π

Ottoman o≈cials appear to have been among the most active participants in

the Veneto-Ottoman trade. Though they rarely traveled outside the empire, they

nonetheless invested signiﬁcant capital in this lucrative enterprise. The impor-

tance of commercial dealings by the Ottoman elite has often been overlooked;

some scholars have argued that the ‘‘administrative bourgeoisie’’ of upper- and

mid-level functionaries were ﬁrst-class consumers but uninvolved in commerce.

Suraiya Faroqhi has allowed that occasionally important administrators used their

"
183,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

163

privileges to proﬁt from trade, but she argues that most Ottoman o≈cials in the

early modern period subscribed to Ibn Khaldûn’s view that ‘‘commercial activity

on the part of the ruler is harmful to his subjects and ruinous to the tax revenue’’

and that such involvement would lead to political decline.∏∫

Venetian records, however, present compelling evidence that many Ottoman

grandees did actively participate in trade, suggesting that views like Khaldûn’s

may have been more prescriptive than descriptive. Naima, the great Ottoman

historian, acknowledged as much when he included political authority, emâret, as

one of three main ways to gain wealth, the other two being agriculture and com-

merce. More recent ly, Metin Kunt has shown how an important Ottoman o≈cial

of the seventeenth century, Dervi ¸s Pa ¸sa, was actively engaged in agriculture and

commerce, and annually imported forty million akçe of luxury goods alone, all

non-taxable. Dervi ¸s appears not to have been alone: Peçevi, a seventeenth-century

Ottoman historian reported that in the previous century the income of frontier

pa¸sas and beys far exceeded that of the viziers, and de Groot has argued that if

early modern Ottoman grandees ‘‘did not enter the marketplace in person . . .

[they did understand] how to proﬁt from foreign trade,’’ often retaining mer-

chants who traded for them, even in contraband if proﬁtable.∏Ω

O≈cials’ involvement in commercial activities can be traced back at least to the

conquest of Constantinople, when Çandarlı Halil Pa ¸sa traded with prominent

Venetian merchants immediately following the cessation of hostilities. Indeed,

some gazis believed he had favored peace to advance his own business a√airs.

Early evidence of ‘‘Askeri entrepreneurialism’’ became more common in the six-
teenth century. Both ˙Ibrahim and Rüstem Pa ¸sas, grand viziers under Süleyman

Kanuni, had important commercial considerations, and Kafadar has found that,

despite e√orts to discourage it, even the famed janissary corps often engaged in

commerce, including in contraband goods.π≠ Because Italian cities were willing to

pay higher prices for grain than the capital’s command economy would, a wide-

spread illegal trade arose involving timar holders, governors, janissaries, and

even the ulema, who could earn up to 20 percent above o≈cial grain prices by

selling to Venetians.π∞ As one historian has suggested, by the late sixteenth cen-

tury ‘‘contraband carried the day,’’ and Ottoman o≈cials were not opposed to

beneﬁting from this economic situation, despite its real dangers: one vizier was

executed, due in part to charges that he had stolen goods from the people and

traded them in Christendom.π≤

There was signiﬁcant commercial activity by Ottoman o≈cials and soldiers

with the Venetian nation in Constantinople. For example, a janissary, Mahmud,

who had ‘‘a fruit shop in the Tophane,’’ is mentioned, as are several other janis-

"
184,"164

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

saries who sent seventeen sacks of cotton to Venice and were granted a customs’

exemption because they needed to leave for the Persian front.π≥ Another group

which naturally tended toward commerce was the çavu¸ses, members of the Birun-u

hümayun, or the palace’s external service, who, because of their frequent o≈cial

travels outside the empire, were in a position both to carry their own goods and

to make contacts with agents who could represent them. As Pedani-Fabris has

shown, some ﬁfty-four of these representatives traveled to Venice between 1570

and 1645. In some instances the çavu¸s came speciﬁcally for o≈cial, commercial

purposes on behalf of the sultan or some other important ﬁgure in the Porte,

functioning as something akin to a ‘‘marchand de la Cour.’’ More often, they

engaged in trade on the side for their personal beneﬁt.π∂

One such emissary actively involved in Levantine commerce was Hamza

Çavu ¸s. He owned at least two ships (the Santa Maria di Loreto and the San Gio-

vanni Battista) that plied the Mediterranean from Chios to Venice and on which

Venetian merchants regularly bought space, despite laws which forbade their use

of foreign vessels: Hamza also transported his goods on Venetian ships.π∑ He

utilized the bailo’s court to resolve commercial conﬂicts, and in one instance he

agreed to accept a Christian, appointed by the bailo, as an arbitrator in a commer-

cial disagreement involving Piero de Grassi, a Venetian merchant. The arbitra-

tor’s resolution, accepted by both merchants, favored Hamza and ordered Grassi

to pay him 6000 akçe.π∏ From the available records it seems that Hamza never

traveled to Venice in an o≈cial capacity, but he did retain the services of a mer-

chant who had been active in Constantinople for some years, Pasqualino Leoni,

whom he knew personally, to ship silk from Venice. These goods were sent in

the name of Hamza’s son, Mehmed, perhaps as a ruse to avoid duties or legal

entanglements.ππ

Commercial involvement was not limited to the çavu¸ses. Other, more inﬂuen-

tial Ottoman o≈cials also participated, as the case of Ca’fer Pa ¸sa suggests. Ca’fer

(written variously by Venetian scribes as Gia√er, Cafer, Ga’fer), a Calabrian rene-

gade who was probably initially captured by corsairs (Selaniki says he came to the

Porte from Tunis), was described in Venetian records as a ‘‘homo savio, amico de

cristiani.’’π∫ While he held a variety of important positions, Ca’fer made something

of a career as beylerbeyi of the newly conquered ey ¯alet of Cyprus, serving there on

three separate occasions. In 1587 he turned down a more prestigious o≈ce in

favor of remaining on the island, and in 1603 he paid bribes of 6,000 ducats, and

gave an advance of 25,000 ducats to the sultan on the monies he anticipated

collecting, in order to be reappointed beylerbeyi of Cyprus.πΩ From both Ottoman

"
185,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

165

and Venetian sources we can follow Ca’fer’s later career: Naima reports that

‘‘Ja’fer Pasha, the European, who had been three times the beylerbeyi of Cyprus’’

became kapudanpa¸sa, though he was almost immediately replaced. According to

Selaniki, ‘‘Frenk Ca’fer Pasha’’ then became beylerbeyi of Tripoli, though he ‘‘was

dismissed upon it being said, ‘He has not sent the Treasury shipment on time.’ ’’

A Venetian document indicates that Ca’fer then became beylerbeyi of Cairo.∫≠

One reason Ca’fer coveted the governorship of Cyprus was his extensive in-

volvement in Levantine trade, stretching from at least 1587 to the last years of

his life. The fact that his house was located in the bedestan of Galata, amid all

the European merchants, is some indication of his commercial involvements.∫∞

Ca’fer was especially active in the cotton trade, which had been an important

Cypriot export since at least the fourteenth century: in one transaction he sent

cotton valued at 4,536 ducats to Venice via a Candiot merchant; in another, eighty-

one sacks of cotton were shipped to the lagoon.∫≤ Ca’fer utilized his high positions

as a means to increase his own personal wealth; technically his cotton exports

were considered contraband, as cotton cloth and thread were classed as strategic

material needed for ship sails. It is possible he used his status to procure an export

license, though these were in theory di≈cult to obtain.∫≥ He sent his goods to

Venice marked with his o≈cial seal so that they would be recognized and given

preferential treatment, had Venetian secretaries come to his residence to create

legal documents that were presented before the V Savii, and in several instances

corresponded direct ly with the doge regarding his ﬁnancial dealings.∫∂ He also

informed the baili on matters in the divan and worked to free Venetian slaves and

to protect Venice’s interests in the Ottoman Empire, no doubt to curry favor for

his own interests, both political and economic.

While Ca’fer personally managed his commerce and intervened with Venetian

authorities on his own behalf, he employed a variety of Greek, Muslim, and

Jewish agents to carry out the actual trading. This is not surprising given the

importance of his government o≈ces and the weighty responsibilities associated

with them. He also worked with Venetian merchants, such as Giacomo Biasii,

who carried a shipment of Ca’fer’s cotton to Venice, where he was to turn over the

proﬁt to either the beylerbeyi ’s Cypriot or Muslim agent in the city. Biasii even-

tually died en route to Venice, and Ca’fer commissioned the Ottoman-Jewish

merchant David Abudenti’s agent in Venice, Rabbi Mosè Mazaod, to recover the

goods from Biasii’s heirs. In addition, Ca’fer engaged Pasqualino Leoni, who also

traded with Resul A ˘ga, to recover money owed him by a Cypriot merchant and the

former Venetian consul of Cyprus, and he did business with a Venetian patrician

"
186,"166

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

from the Ruzini clan.∫∑ Ca’fer also owned and operated a ship on the route be-

tween Constantinople and Candia in partnership with a Greek, perhaps Candiot,

merchant.∫∏

After becoming kapudanpa¸sa in 1607, he continued in his commercial deal-

ings. In that year, he had the Venetian secretary come to his ship and, ‘‘speaking

in Frankish,’’ declared he had received 5,000 ounces of gold from Abudenti,

whose agent had collected them from the o≈ce of the V Savii in Venice. By 1609,

Ca’fer had lost his position as head of the Ottoman ﬂeet but still sent ten sacks of

cotton to Venice, again through Abudenti’s agent in the city. He died in 1620 and

left a fortune of 200,000 ducats.∫π

Ca’fer Pa ¸sa is not the only Ottoman o≈cial involved in commercial activities to

appear in Venetian records.∫∫ It was quite common for the ‘‘upper administrative

class’’ to invest their fortunes with merchants involved in international com-

merce.∫Ω Indeed, Muslim agents trading on behalf of the sultans at times came to

Venice; the shahs of Persia likewise often sent goods with factors to Venice, and

even as far as London.Ω≠ Grand viziers were quite active in the Venetian trade, as

in the case of Süleyman’s viziers. In 1598 Bernardino and Agostino Agazzi, two

successful Venetian merchants in Constantinople, received 190,680 akçe from
Mustafa Bey, agent of the Grand Vizier ˙Ibrahim, as payment to their partner

Pasqualino Leoni for silk cloths. Several years later, a Mehmed A ˘ga sent 130 bolts

of camlet belonging to the Grand Vizier Nassuf to two Venetian agents.Ω∞ In 1613,

a grand vizier sent to Venice with Dervi ¸s Çavu ¸s ‘‘ﬁfty quantities of camlet that are

his own goods, and another sixty quantities of silk which belong to the casna of the

Grand Signor, so that they may be sold, with the proﬁt being reinvested in an

equal amount of silk cloths to be conducted to Constantinople.’’ In Venice, Dervi ¸s

requested a customs exemption for the goods, which the V Savii opposed because

of the bad precedent it would set for other Ottoman o≈cials trading in Venice.

The reasoning is illuminating: ‘‘under this cover of exempting the merchandise

of the principal Turkish ministers, all the merchandise from here on out would be

made out as belonging to these subjects,’’ suggesting that commerce by Ottoman

o≈cials was signiﬁcant enough that such a precedent could threaten Venetian

customs’ income.Ω≤

Despite the V Savii’s negative response, Ottoman grandees regularly re-

quested special treatment for their goods and agents. In 1590, another grand

vizier preparing to send twenty thousand ducats’ worth of raw silk to Venice

requested that Girolamo Lippomano provide a letter recommending his factor as

a form of insurance. The bailo reported to the Senate: ‘‘I considered all the perils

"
187,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

167

of the voyages, of the negotiation, and even though I was very pleased for him to

send his capital to that city [Venice], and that he might become increasingly

involved by having his goods there . . . [nonetheless] I did not want to put either

my pen or my word on this enterprise.’’Ω≥ Instead, the bailo convinced the vizier to

send his goods with the Venetian-Ottoman merchant Edoardo Gagliano, thus

avoiding taking o≈cial responsibility for the safe arrival of the merchandise.

As this dispatch suggests, involvement in trade with Ottoman o≈cials could

be a double-edged sword. While their commerce was great ly sought after, direct

involvement in facilitating this trade had the potential to open the door to re-

quests for special treatment, tax exemptions, priority in loading goods on ships

with limited space, trade in contraband goods, avoidance of customs duties, and

especially Venetian liability for damages incurred in transit.Ω∂ Despite all these

negative ramiﬁcations, Venetian o≈cials tried to accommodate these inﬂuential

merchants because of the value of their o≈cial trade. They helped them pene-

trate the Venetian bureaucracy, introduced them to agents, intervened in dis-

putes, and even occasionally reduced duties on their goods. When one grand

vizier requested a customs exemption, the V Savii, in recognition of the ‘‘temper

of this negotiation,’’ recommended that he be given an expensive gift of clothing

and that his goods be assessed only a half duty. They reasoned that it was impor-

tant to retain his friendship because he was in a position to ‘‘bring great beneﬁt to

the port of Spalato,’’ which was one of Venice’s most successful commercial

initiatives at the turn of the century. In a similar incident, a commercial dispute

prevented the departure of a caramousal owned by a high Ottoman o≈cial. The V

Savii recommended that the matter be expedited since the patron was ‘‘of the

Turkish nation . . . [and] has conducted diverse goods in this city; it is not conve-

nient that he be impeded in his negotiations with length and di≈culties and

litigations.’’Ω∑

It was also not uncommon for merchants representing high Ottoman o≈cials

to be caught with contraband, or goods on which the appropriate duties had not

been paid. Venice had to proceed with caution in these instances, as strict enforce-

ment of commercial laws had potential political ramiﬁcations. In 1615, for exam-

ple, contraband merchandise belonging to three o≈cials was conﬁscated. In an

attempt to avoid controversy, the Senate directed the bailo to explain that while

Venice favored Ottoman merchants, this case was too serious to be overlooked,

and had to be pursued in order to ensure that other merchants respected Venetian

laws. In another instance, several Ottoman-Muslim agents carrying merchandise

belonging to ‘‘a very important Turkish minister of the Grand Signor in the city of

"
188,"168

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Bursa’’ asked for the return of some silk that had been concealed among other

goods without a bill of lading. The V Savii granted this request, though they

required that the appropriate duties be paid on the cloth.Ω∏

Despite such incidents, Venice’s policy was to facilitate all Ottoman trade,

regardless of who brought it to the city. With Ottoman o≈cials this was accom-

plished by sending secretaries and dragomans to register their commercial trans-

actions, by providing safe-conducts and letters of introduction, and by obtaining a

range of special privileges for them. This policy was maintained in recognition of

the reciprocal nature of the relationship between the Ottoman and Venetian

o≈cials. Each provided important services to the other and facilitated his (or

occasionally her, as in the case of several inﬂuential Ottoman women in the

harem) political and commercial objectives— personal or public. Again, the case

of Ca’fer Pa ¸sa is illustrative: he assisted Venice by carrying important correspon-

dence to Cyprus at the request of the bailo and wrote personally (in Italian) to

various baili informing them on internal machinations, private meetings and

important developments in the Porte. Ca’fer also attempted to inﬂuence Ottoman

policies in Venice’s favor. In a 1594 letter to Marco Venier, written to reassure him

‘‘that I have not forgotten our friendship and promises,’’ Ca’fer reported on his

e√orts to free a number of slaves and his intervention with the kapudanpa¸sa to

protect Venetian territories, concluding ‘‘God knows that which I have done . . .

for every one of your territories, both on sea and on land.’’Ωπ

The relationship was not one-sided, of course. Ca’fer was neither a turncoat

nor a Venetian mole, but rather engaged in a personal diplomacy that furthered

both his personal political and economic fortunes, as well as those of the sultan,

and beneﬁted Venice at the same time. Because of the complex layers of his iden-

tity— former Christian, Ottoman-Muslim o≈cial, international merchant, per-

sonal friend— it was not a stretch for him to serve his Ottoman master and beneﬁt

from contacts with his former co-religionists. In implicit exchange for his as-

sistance, the baili provided Ca’fer with information and interventions that favored

him economically and politically. In 1601, when a dispute before the V Savii

between Ca’fer and his agent was proceeding ‘‘with some lukewarmness,’’ Agos-

tino Nani encouraged the Senate to expedite the matter because, he wrote, the

Ottoman was in a position to help or hurt the city. Two years later, the bailo

Francesco Contarini discussed with the grand vizier some problems that had

occurred in Cyprus ‘‘because Ca’fer Pa ¸sa had not been found there, whose gover-

nance of the island was very pleasing to our merchants because of his good

qualities.’’ Contarini intervened at the Porte ‘‘at the request of Ca’fer,’’ and this

combined with the six thousand ducats in gifts Ca’fer expended, certainly played a

"
189,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

169

role in his reappointment as beylerbeyi of Cyprus two months later.Ω∫ While mer-

chants such as Ca’fer Pa ¸sa, Resul A ˘ga, and Hamza Çavu ¸s were certainly among

the more important Ottoman merchants trading with Venice, the template of

their experiences was not unique or exceptional. Evidences of numerous other

Muslim merchants also appear in lesser detail in Venetian notarial records.ΩΩ

Just as Ottomans engaged direct ly in commerce with Venice, so too Venetian

records reinforce that Ottoman-Muslim merchants did travel extensively outside

Islamic lands, either carrying their own goods, or those of other merchants and

o≈cials. Compelling evidence from throughout Europe and the Near East sup-

ports this assertion: in the late sixteenth century there was an Ottoman-Muslim

merchant community in Calicut, a similar enclave of 400 traders in Diu in west-

ern India, and numerous ‘‘Turkish and Arab merchants’’ in the Javanese town of

Bantam. Ottoman-Muslim (and Persian) merchants were present at fairs in cen-

tral Italy already in 1524, and a Florentine document of 1521 refers to ‘‘Turks and

Greeks [in Florence] to buy good loads of cloth.’’∞≠≠ An English account of the late

sixteenth century mentions the visit of a Mustafa to London ‘‘come but slenderly

attended with some dozen of Turkes,’’ and Nabil Matar’s recent work suggests

that this was not an isolated incident.∞≠∞ And recent ly Gilles Veinstein has shown

the importance of Ottoman merchants, both o≈cial and independent, in Poland-

Lithuania and Moscow in the ﬁrst half of the sixteenth century, who traded in furs,

falcons, tin and hides.∞≠≤

One of the most frequent destinations of Ottoman merchants was Venice:

when Henry Blount sailed from the city for Constantinople in 1634, he reported

that he was the only Christian on the ship and was surrounded by ‘‘Turks and

Jewes’’ returning from trading in the Ottoman capital.∞≠≥ A small, intermittent

Muslim presence in Venice can be traced back to the early ﬁfteenth century.∞≠∂

Ottomans had received reciprocal rights to trade in Venice already in 1419, and

reports of Muslims in the city appear throughout the ﬁfteenth century. Indeed,

Ottoman merchants were favored with lower customs rates and other special

treatment that put them on the same level in many ways as the o≈cial patrician

merchants of Venice.∞≠∑ This Muslim presence in Venice is underlined visually by

the turbaned ﬁgures dressed in eastern garb who begin cropping up in late

ﬁfteenth century Venetian paintings, such as Bellini’s Procession of the Relic of the

True Cross, Mansueti’s Miracle of the Relic at San Lio, and Carpaccio’s Healing of a

Possessed Man.∞≠∏

By 1546 Ottoman merchants’ extended visits to the lagoon seem to have be-

come quite regular, as suggested by the rising number of complaints about dam-

ages and petitions for retribution both to Venetian and Ottoman authorities, and

"
190,"170

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

the increase in çavu¸ses sent to the lagoon to treat these types of issues. These visits

became so frequent that the Grand Vizier Rüstem Pa ¸sa reportedly felt ‘‘embar-

rassed’’ by their regularity. By 1567, the number of Muslim merchants was nota-

ble enough that the papal nuncio to Venice judged that the ‘‘multitude of Turks’’

might prove a fertile ground for Jesuit missionaries. Statistics from the War of the

Holy League give concrete numbers to this anecdotal evidence: seventy-ﬁve Mus-

lims and ninety-seven Jews trading in Venice in 1570 were arrested and held at the

outbreak of the war, and immediately following the peace of 1573 their numbers

began to grow signiﬁcant ly.∞≠π While it is impossible to establish the exact value of

this commerce, we get some indication from Bailo Matteo Zane who in 1594

indicated that if the ‘‘Turks’’ and Jews could be compelled to pay all their duties the

cottimo in Constantinople would increase by four thousand ducats annually, al-

most double the ﬁve thousand ducats he was present ly collecting. The cottimo on

incoming goods at the end of the century was 0.75 percent, and on outgoing

goods was 1.25 percent, thus the value of this Ottoman trade would appear to have

been in the range of 400,000 ducats annually.∞≠∫

Yet another indication of the growing presence of Ottoman-Muslim mer-

chants in Venice is the growing number of brokers (sensale or sansar in Italian,

from the Arabic simsâr ) who were sanctioned by the V Savii. In 1587 their number

was estimated at between ﬁfteen and twenty, which was a signiﬁcant increase in

response to the great growth in the number of ‘‘Turkish’’ merchants trading in

Venice. These brokers were described as ‘‘men of litt le good, some of them having

turned Christian from Turk or Jew.’’ In 1582, two Muslims, ‘‘Hasan and Risuan,

heads of the Bosnian nation,’’ requested that the V Savii appoint a Slavic-speaking

broker, as they felt they were being taken advantage of due to language di≈-

culties. The regular brokers opposed this, stating that of the twenty brokers in

Venice who knew Turkish, four knew Slavic as well.∞≠Ω By 1621, when the much

larger Fondaco dei turchi in its present location on the Canal Grande opened (yet

another indication of the increasing presence of Muslim merchants),∞∞≠ there

were thirty-three ‘‘Turkish’’ brokers out of a total of 190.∞∞∞

Of course the presence of such a large number of persons regarded as inﬁdels

could create di≈culties within the city, and not only commercially. In 1605 a

‘‘secret person’’ denounced a man who ‘‘publicly sells young men of bad life,

conducting them in all places, even to Turks in their own hostels.’’ Similarly, in

1603 several Ottoman-Muslims in Venice ran into di≈culties with o≈cials, in-

cluding one man ‘‘accused of homicide,’’ who had to pay a three hundred ducat

ﬁne, and a ‘‘Hungarian Turk’’ who paid a ﬁfty ducat ﬁne for drawing a weapon in

piazza San Marco against Venetian o≈cials.∞∞≤

Veneto-Ottoman commerce was not limited to Muslims in Venice: though

smaller than in previous centuries, as we have seen, the early modern Venetian

merchant community in Constantinople was still involved in a wide range of

commercial activities in which they traded and interacted direct ly with the Otto-

man merchants of all stripes. One such example is long-distance shipping. Al-

though the Senate, in an e√ort to stimulate Venetian shipping, forbade Venetian

merchants from loading their goods on foreign ships, in the case of Ottoman

ships this legislation was often ignored.∞∞≥ Venetian merchants regularly con-

tracted with Muslim ship captains to carry merchandise, especially grain, to Ven-

ice and the stato da mar. In particular in 1592, when the Levantine wheat markets

were temporarily reopened to foreign traders in response to the extreme shortage

a√ecting Italy, numerous Ottoman captains and their ships were engaged to

supply Venice’s voracious appetite for grain.∞∞∂ Initially, Venetian merchants tried

to send a Christian overseer with each ship, but this practice was quickly aban-

doned and Ottoman-Muslim captains were entrusted with large sums of cash to

purchase grain, and the liberty to decide where and at what price to buy it, with

no supervision.∞∞∑ Sales of ships between European and Muslim entrepreneurs

were also quite common, as the cases of Ca’fer Pa ¸sa and Hamza Çavu ¸s suggest,

and even the renegade kapudanpa¸sa Çigalazade Sinan sold a ship to the French

ambassador.∞∞∏

Though in theory Venetian partnerships with Muslims, and indeed with

all foreigners, were illegal, they did occur.∞∞π More common was intercommu-

nal commerce: there is ample evidence that Venetian and Muslim merchants

in Constantinople traded direct ly with each other, without intermediaries. In

1591, for example, Gianantonio and Francesco Perla, factors for the patrician

Bertucci Ciuran, sold Ali, a merchant in Galata, sixty multicolored cloths. When

a Venetian merchant, Pietro Pencini, failed and ﬂed Constantinople ‘‘many Turk-

ish merchants’’ came to the bailate trying to ﬁnd him to resolve outstanding

commercial matters. In another case, Tommaso Bonastori made a trade with

Hasan Çelebi, ‘‘and they touched their hands two times saying that the bazaar was

done, and that as a Muslim he would never back out on his promise.’’ The

Venetian had a sensale who interpreted the transaction, but he was direct ly in-

volved in closing the deal. Bonastori also sold some Venetian paper direct ly to

Süleyman A ˘ga, head of the Guild of Papermakers, who came to deal with him in

person.∞∞∫

One area in which Muslims were actively involved with Venetian merchants

was money-lending. Though traditionally this activity has been associated with

Jews, many Muslims, including members of the sultan’s household, lent funds

"
192,"172

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

to European merchants and diplomats, often at rates signiﬁcant ly above those

of their Jewish competitors.∞∞Ω Muslim religious endowments were also an im-

portant institutional player in the money-markets of Constantinople, and many

Christian slaves received funds from them to purchase their freedom.∞≤≠ While

Venetians, including members of the baili’s household, preferred to borrow funds

from within the trading nation, on occasion they turned to Muslim lenders, as

when a Venetian dragoman obtained a loan of two hundred ducats at 15 percent

interest from an Ottoman çavu¸s. The baili also borrowed, especially in the seven-

teenth century as cottimo funds became insu≈cient to cover the regular expenses

of the chancellery, as evidenced in Resul A ˆga’s loan to Giorgio Giustinian. Related

to this service, Ottoman-Muslims also served as pawn brokers for the interna-

tional community.∞≤∞

While scholars have often overstated the importance of minority intermedi-

aries in Constantinople’s commerce, there is no question that such ﬁgures were

involved in commercial transactions, however, not to the exclusion of Muslim or

Venetian merchants.∞≤≤ To a certain extent, intermediaries existed in both Venice

and Constantinople to provide linguistic assistance and to ensure that neither

party was defrauded, particularly in cases involving expensive goods. As the case

of Bonastori indicates, this did not mean that Venetian or Muslim merchants did

not treat direct ly with each other. In some instances, members of the Venetian

nation even served as intermediaries for Ottoman-Muslim merchants, as when a

Murad Pa ¸sa paid a Venetian cernitor two ducats to sell his wool for him. In other

instances we ﬁnd Jewish merchants sending goods to Venice under Ottoman

names, as when David Abudenti sent some alum under the name of Kabil A ˘ga

and his son Halil to Venice.∞≤≥

While it is generally maintained that Jews were the primary intermediaries in

Levantine commerce, in the Venetian sources they appear to have been more

involved in their own trade. When an intermediary appeared on behalf of a

merchant—Christian, Muslim, or Jew— that relationship was explicit ly stated by

the chancellery secretary. It is possible that Venetian merchants did utilize Jews

(or other minorities) as intermediaries and simply did not indicate this fact in

registering transactions. Given the sheer number of exchanges that occurred,

however, one would expect a representative sampling to appear: instead they are

quite rare.∞≤∂ This evidence would seem to support the contention that Venetian

merchants, because of their long-standing experience and position in Constan-

tinople, their familiarity with the modalities of commerce, their knowledge of

local languages, and their relations with Ottoman authorities, generally did not

rely on intermediaries. The exception to this was periods of war, when Venetian

"
193,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

173

merchants did resort to brokers, usually Jews, to continue their commercial deal-

ings uninterrupted. In times of peace, however, because Venetian, Jewish, and

Ottoman-Muslim merchants all paid the same cottimi, any tax or customs beneﬁt

available from trading through intermediaries was e√ectively removed.∞≤∑

Recent research is showing more and more the inaccuracy of ‘‘old ideas re-

ceived in the West [which] have generally exaggerated the reservations of Muslims

in the Ottoman Empire towards economic and commercial activities.’’∞≤∏ It is

clear that Ottoman-Muslim merchants, including important o≈cials of the Porte,

were actively engaged in a lively, direct trade with Venetian merchants both in

Constantinople and Venice. The documentary evidence amply demonstrates that

Ottoman-Muslim merchants and their agents regularly traveled to and traded in

Venice. Minority intermediaries did not dominate the trade as has often been

held, though they certainly did play a role. Simple ethnocultural generalizations

about Muslims and commerce mask the more diverse and varied reality of trade

at all levels of society, both in Venice and in Constantinople, and they mask the

degree to which these commercial exchanges resulted in friendship and enduring

relationships between seemingly antithetical groups.

s o c i a l a n d p e r s o n a l r e l a t i o n sh i p s

In the decades after 1570 Ottoman society is generally depicted as becoming

increasingly xenophobic and closed, embracing traditional Islamic values and

refusing any real constructive relations with non-Muslims. In this era, it is said,

interaction between Ottomans and Europeans was conﬁned ‘‘to an ‘anomalous’

stratum of renegades.’’ This view, however, overlooks the very real evidence of

interaction between the many groups present in the Ottoman capital, especially in

Galata. Renegades were able to penetrate Ottoman society with such ease pre-

cisely because they were not anomalies: ‘‘They already had much in common with

numerous others in this society, in which migration and conversion were com-

mon. There was a shared discourse even beyond the migrants and converts,

because there were shared interests.’’∞≤π The Venetian nation in Constantinople

provides extensive evidence of the existence of this shared intercultural discourse,

in which the malleable boundaries between Muslim and Christian, Ottoman, and

European permitted interaction across a wide spectrum of activities.

Given their long residences in Constantinople, and their regular interaction

with Ottomans of varying estates, it is no surprise that Venetians developed a

range of personal relationships with their hosts.∞≤∫ The dispatches contain many

references by baili and others to Ottoman-Muslims whom they describe as

"
194,"174

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

friends. Gianfrancesco Morosini referred to a ‘‘Turk, an old friend of the house-

hold, a person of great consideration, who is Müteferrika of the scribes’’ of the

sultan, who kept him regularly informed on the a√airs of the palace. Similarly,

Lorenzo Bernardo was accompanied on the ﬁrst leg of his return trip home to

Venice by ‘‘several Turkish friends of his household,’’ and Ottaviano Bon refers

several times to ‘‘Turks’’ who were his friends, including ‘‘Halil Pa ¸sa amico mio.’’∞≤Ω

Certainly this use of the term amico must be qualiﬁed and understood in its

historical context. In Venetian diplomatic sources, amico was used to signify

someone to whom a person was attached by a√ection, and someone who favored

Venice and its representatives; a Venetian advice manual dating from the 1570s

enjoins the ambassador ‘‘to gain for himself as friends the domestics and favor-

ites of those that have authority.’’∞≥≠ Clearly a functional side to friendship existed;

however, we cannot dismiss such relationships as entirely political. Certainly the

pragmatic need not necessarily preclude the personal. Both aspects may, and

often did, coexist. As one scholar has accurately observed, there existed in late

medieval and early modern society a ‘‘tension . . . between the ‘instrumental’ and

the idealistic sides of friendship.’’∞≥∞ The evidence suggests that the term amico

was commonly used by Venetian and Ottoman representatives to describe rela-

tionships that went beyond o≈cial duties and pure, political interests. Regular

diplomatic encounters, philosophical discussions, social engagements, and pri-

vate correspondence all point to personal relationships that may more closely

approximate modern, a√ective friendship.

Both the pragmatic and the personal elements of amicizia are clearly present

in the experiences of numerous baili and Ottoman grandees. When Paolo Con-

tarini arrived in Constantinople, he reported that Venice had no friends there due

to changes in the Ottoman court, and so ‘‘I set myself with every means to procure

several friendships, it appearing to me that they were necessary to terminate

successfully negotiations, and to have the information which is so important and

necessary to the government of [Venice].’’∞≥≤ These means included personal

visits with important o≈cials, liberal use of gifts or bribes, providing a range of

personal services, and the maintenance of an open table in the bailate to which

many important Ottomans came regularly, and at which the wine ﬂowed freely.∞≥≥

Another bailo, Ottaviano Bon, in referring to a vizier who was killed by order of

the sultan, indicated ‘‘I cannot help but be pained by this mishap, because I had

made him my close friend, and up to now I had obtained everything that I had

asked.’’∞≥∂

Ottoman o≈cials similarly refer to Venetians as their amici, despite the belief

of some observers that ‘‘Turks’’ were ‘‘not capable of real friendship toward a

"
195,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

175

Christian.’’∞≥∑ A bostancıba¸sı who several times assisted Alvise Contarini, and

indeed was reprimanded for being too favorable to the bailo, told the Venetian

diplomat ‘‘you are my buon amico.’’ When Giovanni Cappello visited the kapu-

danpa¸sa, ‘‘Seeing me before I had sat down, he took me by the hand and with

words of a√ection called me his dear and beloved friend,’’ and upon hearing that

Cappello was leaving soon for Venice ‘‘he showed sorrow . . . trying to persuade

me to have my family come here, with the promise that he would write to Your

Lordship for my continued residence in these parts, adding that in any case he

would never forget me.’’∞≥∏

As this encounter suggests, because of the regular contact that their o≈cial

duties imposed, it was not uncommon for the baili, secretaries, and other o≈cial

members of the nation and important ﬁgures in the Porte to become friendly,

even intimates. During a visit, an Ottoman o≈cial, sensing Cristoforo Valier was

depressed, inquired, ‘‘What is wrong Bailo? Why are you in bad spirits? Why do

you not laugh as you are wont to do?’’ When Agostino Nani went to congratulate a

new vizier, ‘‘ﬁnding the pa¸sa entirely unoccupied I remained for more than an

hour reasoning with him about various pleasing things.’’∞≥π O≈cial functions also

provided opportunity for interaction. At the festivities celebrating Almoro Nani’s

presentation in the divan, an o≈cial commented that he looked like his brother,

Agostino, who had been bailo a decade previous and said he hoped he would ‘‘be

similar to him in other ways too.’’ Because of the reputation of his brother, Nani

also received several gifts usually reserved for extraordinary ambassadors, includ-

ing two horses from the beylerbeyi of Greece, given as a ‘‘compliment for the

friendship he already had with the brother of the new bailo.’’∞≥∫ Gifts could also be

small, simple expressions of sentiment, such as the ﬂowers that Halil Pa ¸sa, ‘‘hav-

ing placed a hand on my shoulder,’’ gave to Simone Contarini while both were

waiting at the divan.∞≥Ω Friendships between Ottomans and Venetians were not

limited to Constantinople: Sanudo reports that in 1522 the nobleman Gianfran-

cesco Mocenigo traveled from Mestre where he was podestà and capitano to Venice

to visit with an Ottoman çavu¸s, with whom he had established a ‘‘close friendship’’

two years previous.∞∂≠ While gift-giving can be read in purely functional terms as

intended to buy favor, gifts had a great deal of ritualistic importance in many early

modern societies. This was especially true of the Ottoman Empire, where gifts, or

piskes, were ‘‘a mark of respect and dependence.’’∞∂∞

The dragomans of Venice, who spent most of their days at the divan negotiat-

ing and observing, because they spoke the language and were not regularly re-

placed as were the baili, not surprisingly established close relations with Ottoman

o≈cials. The grand dragoman Marcantonio Borisi in the ﬁrst years of the seven-

"
196,"176

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

teenth century was well known in the Porte for his regal dress and bearing; at

Almoro Nani’s reception, the kaiceman playfully made sport of Borisi ‘‘who for his

dress, which was very pompous, and for the way he carried himself, made him

appear a Prince of Bogdania; thus the pa¸sa responded with a smile on his face,

that if it pleased him, it seemed good to name him that Prince whom he already

appeared like,’’ and then went on to praise warmly the Venetian dragoman.∞∂≤

One of the most vivid records we have of the sociability between Ottomans and

Venetians is that of Doge Andrea Gritti. As a young man Gritti lived for over

twenty years in Constantinople as a grain merchant and fathered three illegiti-

mate sons there by an Ottoman-Greek woman. During this time he became

friendly with Sultan Bayezid II and Grand Vizier Ahmed Pa ¸sa. These friendships

probably saved him from execution in the war of 1499– 1503, when he was caught

forwarding information to Venice. On his return to Constantinople as ambas-

sador to treat for peace in 1503, he was joined by his friend the çavu¸s Ali Bey, and

‘‘a great many people’’ ﬂocked to the shore to greet him, ‘‘he being loved and

revered by all for his optimal customs known from the time that he was a mer-

chant here in Pera.’’ The sultan and vizier sent an honor guard of o≈cials and

mounted men, as well as gifts of delicacies and a horse for Gritti ‘‘which [was] not

customary.’’ So warm were Gritti’s relations with the Ottoman Empire that at his

election to the dogeship, his detractors argued that ‘‘one who has three bastard

sons in Turkey should not be made Doge.’’∞∂≥

Other baili, too, thrived socially in the Porte. Simone Contarini, for example,

became so close with Grand Vizier Murad that, because ‘‘his perfect will toward

me had passed to such a point,’’ Murad’s own servants would ask the bailo to

intercede with their master on their behalf, which he often did, ‘‘and [he] always

obtained’’ what they requested. Murad maintained this friendship, even though it

apparent ly cost him politically: Contarini quoted him as saying ‘‘Bailo, every day it

costs me more because you are my friend and my enemies have wanted to take

advantage of your name to wound me.’’∞∂∂

Contarini struck up a lasting friendship with another important Ottoman

o≈cial, Halil Pa ¸sa.∞∂∑ Originally from Albania, Halil Pa ¸sa (1565– 1629) was an

inﬂuential ﬁgure in the Porte in the early seventeenth century, serving as ka-

pudanpa¸sa and grand vizier, and was called by Sagredo ‘‘the best head in Tur-

key.’’∞∂∏ Early in his career, as an o≈cial in Bosnia, he was assisted by Venice in a

matter of importance, which ‘‘he conserve[d] in memory’’; this became the foun-

dation of a lasting, mutually beneﬁcial, relationship.∞∂π Contarini and Halil Pa ¸sa

maintained an active correspondence after the former left Constantinople in

1612. In 1614 the Ottoman grandee wrote the Venetian patrician thanking him for

"
197,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

177

his friendship, expressing ‘‘the love and good will that we bear you,’’ as well as his

hopes that their paths would cross again in Constantinople.∞∂∫ In a 1616 letter,

Halil wrote of his ‘‘sincere friendship’’ for ‘‘his most a√ectionate friend . . . God

knows that if distance and separation of our persons has been necessary, the love

and a√ection of our heart toward you has never ever wavered or moved apart, but

always we remember your optimal condition and good friendship . . . we desire

that the grace of contentment may be conceded to you and all our friends in this

and the next world by the wise Creator.’’∞∂Ω The Ottoman also regularly sent his

regards to Contarini bundled with o≈cial correspondence to the doge, and he

carefully followed the patrician’s political career from Constantinople.

Halil Pa ¸sa’s relationship with Contarini beneﬁted both Constantinople and

Venice in practical ways. Immediately upon being made grand vizier, Halil moved

to rescind an order forcing all Venetians resident in Ottoman lands for more than

a year to pay the harac, even before receiving a request from the Senate to do so.

When he was at the Persian front, he corresponded with ‘‘amico nostro, il Bailo’’

informing him of the progress of the war. His anti-Spanish position was also to

Venice’s advantage and encouraged the city to maintain this inﬂuential friend. In

return, Halil drew on his relationship with Venice to obtain a safe-conduct for his

‘‘dependent’’ Mordecai Cressi, banished by the Esecutori contra bestemmia. He

wrote the doge to recommend that the brother of one of his close advisers, Marin

Pier who was bishop in Antivari, be considered for a higher position. Halil also

used his connections to obtain food delicacies—Piacentine cheeses and Venetian

sugars— for the sultan.∞∑≠

A similar relationship existed between Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokullu and

Bailo Marcantonio Barbaro. When Barbaro was imprisoned during the War of the

Holy League, Sokullu permitted him to visit the baths twice weekly for his health

and sent regularly ‘‘to inquire about my status, to comfort me that I might be in

good spirits.’’ Barbaro wrote, ‘‘I could not nor would I know how to desire a better

disposition from the Magniﬁcent Pa ¸sa, who on many occasions, with me and with

others shows himself to be very humane and a√able.’’ Another striking evidence

of the friendship between these two men is an inscription dictated by Barbaro to

his portraitist, ‘‘hidden in a corner of the canvas,’’ conserved in the Belvedere

Museum in Vienna: ‘‘IMO. Domino Mahomet Pacha Musulmanorum Visario amico

optimo. M.A.B.F.’’∞∑∞

Halil Pa ¸sa was also quite involved with the international community in Con-

stantinople. A Dutch gent leman, Ernst Brink, in the capital as secretary to Cor-

nelius Haga, kept an album amicorum with dedications by members of the foreign

community, as well as many Ottomans, including high court o≈cials, among

"
198,"178

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

them Halil Pa ¸sa, who knew the young Dutchman personally.∞∑≤ The Ottoman o≈-

cial was also a regular participant in the French ambassador Salignac’s hunting

expeditions, often accompanied by other Muslims and court dignitaries. Salig-

nac’s secretary described one of these outings: they ‘‘provided us contentment

and new friendships with Turks, who favored us, and accompanied us to where

the game was. There were çavu¸s and a˘gas who entertained the Ambassador in

their homes, where we were very well treated according to their custom.’’ In the

Ottoman homes, fêtes were organized and attended by women and children:

‘‘Thus we passed the winter gaily.’’∞∑≥ Robert Bargrave, who accompanied the

English ambassador to Constantinople in 1647, similarly described in pleasant

detail his time spent on the estate of an important Ottoman o≈cial: ‘‘We spent

much of our time in a faire Country Pallace, about :6: miles from the City, where

we had many pleasing divertissements, & sundry Priveledges graunted us by our

noble Patron Mamout E√endee, Cadiliskièr (chief Judge) ﬁrst of Anatoli (Asia)

then of Romeli (Europe) . . . oftentimes came theyr great Families of Concubines

(came) to recreat themselves, attended only by theyr Eunuchs, not contented

unless they saw the Franks Chambers (by which name they call all western Chris-

tians) & there enterteining themselves & us, with Dauncing, Leaping, & roaring

like wild persons let out of a Prison.’’∞∑∂

Social encounters were not limited to hunting; erudite Europeans often met

with their Ottoman counterparts for philosophical colloquies or discussions of

current a√airs, politics, religion, and books, not unlike what one might ﬁnd

among the political and diplomatic elites in any important European city. Fran-

cesco Contarini recorded a visit to the home of an Ottoman o≈cial who had

formerly been quite inﬂuential, ‘‘with whom I have remained in close friend-

ship . . . He introduced me with great domesticity into his most intimate rooms,

where he admits no one, and he showed me his books, discussing Astrology and

Medicine which he professes.’’ Contarini also turned to Muslim physicians when

his medico could not cure his lack of appetite, and was given a stone ‘‘cooked and

scalded,’’ which was applied to the bottoms of his feet.∞∑∑ There is no record if this

treatment worked. Similarly, Girolamo Lippomano met a former vizier, Mehmed,

‘‘in his garden toward the Black Sea, who received me with great humanity,’’ and

together they ruminated for over an hour on the problems plaguing the Ottoman

Empire.∞∑∏

Pietro Contarini wrote of two religious o≈cials who ‘‘had wanted to visit me

and to stay with me in recreation and to taste my wine, knowing that I was a friend

of the Turks.’’ They talked at length about Islam, and, to Contarini’s surprise, his

"
199,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

179

guests were quite candid in their assessment of the sultan, whom they described

as ‘‘not very intelligent’’ and unable to act without the inﬂuence of women in the

seraglio. In another instance, the beylerbeyi of Greece invited Lorenzo Bernardo to

his home, where they passed a ‘‘good space of time in several pleasant and cour-

teous discussions.’’∞∑π Halil Pa ¸sa invited Cristoforo Valier to meet him outside the

city because he wanted to ‘‘have me with him for a bit of recreation.’’ Halil passed

an hour ‘‘playing at Zagaglia’’ with his men, while Valier looked on, and then he

took the bailo in his boat to one of his private gardens where they spent the rest of

the day together ‘‘in most pleasing discussions.’’∞∑∫ Similarly, Ambassador Salig-

nac met regularly in his garden for discussions on and practice using arms and

archery, with ‘‘several Turks, his friends and men of quality.’’∞∑Ω

Ottomans, Venetians, and other Europeans often came together at the many

banquets and other social events held at the embassies. It was the practice that a

new diplomatic representative would o√er a large banquet on his arrival, to which

he invited both European and Ottoman guests. At Leonardo Donà’s banquet,

eighty çavu¸ses and their chief, as well as thirty to forty janissaries, came to the

bailate, which was specially decorated for the occasion, and enjoyed a sumptuous

meal. Most of the guests ate in the courtyard, but the chief çavu¸s and ‘‘several

Turks of honor’’ joined the ambassador, his famiglia, the nation, and the French

ambassador inside. At another such banquet in 1636, several hundred people

were entertained, though after the ‘‘Turks’’ left, ‘‘another, more civil’’ banquet was

held for the Greeks, Perots, and other European nations.∞∏≠ Other events in Galata

also drew Ottomans of all varieties: Sanudo, for example, describes in detail the

grand parties held in Galata, and in the next century the French ambassador

sponsored performances of Corneille and Moliére.∞∏∞

In addition to these formal, o≈cial events, individual Ottomans often came to

visit the bailate. Piero Bragadin left an interesting account of a sancak-beyi and

twelve çavu¸ses who came to his house to celebrate the wedding of a nephew of the

sultan: ‘‘My house could be called a tavern, but without payment, I do it willingly,

because when I go to the Porte to the houses of the pa¸sas, they give me such honors

both coming and going that it is not good to mention it.’’∞∏≤ Paolo Contarini echoed

this sentiment and suggested another motivation for maintaining an open-door

policy: he reported that to preserve an honorable reputation in the Porte, it was

necessary ‘‘to feed whomever desires it; and I can say with truth to have had a

continual tavern in my house, and I very often needed to set three or four tables a

day, because in this way friends are conserved and new ones acquired, and the

greatness of this Most Serene Republic is made known to the world.’’∞∏≥

"
200,"180

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

It was common for the baili to entertain diverse guests, especially inﬂuential

Ottoman o≈cials, at their private table. Orembei, the renegade grand dragoman

of the Porte, was a regular dinner guest, often reporting on the a√airs relating to

other European diplomats for whom he interpreted in the divan.∞∏∂ The baili

used such encounters to build networks, obtain information, and treat informally

a wide range of problems. Girolamo Lippomano had a disgrunt led Ottoman-

Muslim merchant and minor customs o≈cial over, ‘‘in the company of other

Turkish friends of the household,’’ and together they were able to convince the

man to resolve his complaint in a favorable manner. Ottaviano Bon entertained

the pa¸sa of Tunisia as he was preparing to leave for his post, no doubt using the

occasion to ensure that the man would favor Venetian interests in North Africa.

The baili too were often dinner guests of Ottoman grandees: Almoro Nani dined

with the kapudanpa¸sa and had to explain that as it was Lent he was not eating

meat, to which the Ottoman good-naturedly responded that he was the ‘‘Captain

of the Sea’’ and he had no shortage of ﬁsh to serve.∞∏∑

Relationships forged in these informal settings often endured well beyond the

end of the baili’s service and their return to Venice, as we have seen in the case of

Simone Contarini. Giovanni Moro, in 1589, went to visit a newly appointed Otto-

man o≈cial who ‘‘entertained me in diverse discussions more than an hour,

telling me that he had served . . . as hoca of this house, and had taught the

language to quondam Lodovico Marucini; nor has he forgotten the favors received

from [Venice], and he o√ered himself to me in any way that he could assist.’’∞∏∏

Francesco Contarini, who returned to Venice in 1619 as extraordinary ambas-

sador, reported meeting a Hasan Pa ¸sa Nacas, who ‘‘was very well-known by me . . .

because in the time of my bailate he came in secrecy to this house . . . to drink

merrily, which he remembers and which he discussed in our discourse; he is of a

very liberal nature.’’∞∏π

Interaction and even friendship were not limited to diplomats and high of-

ﬁcials. The multicultural nature of Galata attracted a wide range of people, in-

cluding many curious Ottoman-Muslims. It served as cultural middle ground

in which ‘‘intra-urban interaction was often more intensive than ha[s] been

assumed.’’∞∏∫

One of the chief attractions that drew Muslim residents and visitors to Galata

was the few remaining Roman Catholic churches in greater Constantinople, all

but one of which were in Galata. As one observer noted:

"
201,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

181

Many of them [Muslims] come inside our churches, particularly San Francesco, out

of curiosity to see the manner of our devotions, and they come here many times

when masses are celebrated, and are amazed at the ceremonies. Also during the

time of the sermon they come to hear, or better, to see the preacher, because few

understand the language except the Christian renegades, and they depart without

any problem. At Easter time, as they know it is our most solemn feast, at my sermon

I saw more than 200 of them between the ambassador’s janissaries, who are there

for protection, and others on Friday, which among them is like Sunday. Most women

and youths come from Constantinople on a stroll, out of curiosity sparked by those

who other times have been there, and they ask to hear the organ, and then when they

leave they give alms or a tip.∞∏Ω

In the ﬁfteenth century, Mehmed the Conqueror was reported to have attended

services in San Francesco.∞π≠ Popular religious feasts also drew large numbers of

Muslims. The feast of the Holy Sacrament especially drew a ‘‘crowd not only of

diverse Christian nations, but also the Turks themselves,’’ who came in such

great numbers that no empty seats could be found. And during Christmas fes-

tivities, ‘‘Turks . . . [had] the habit of bringing many ﬂowers in hand to give to

Christians.’’∞π∞

The activities of the few Christian religious still active in Galata were also of

particular interest. When four Capuchin monks arrived in Galata in 1626 to

establish a school and a mission at the Church of Saint George, their unique attire

attracted typical curiosity.∞π≤ Initially the fathers experienced occasional mistreat-

ment: one was attacked in the street by a boy who threw a stone at him; others

claimed that Muslims who lived nearby regularly sent toddlers who could barely

walk with knifes to harass the fathers, who would return the children to their

mothers. Over time, however, relations between the Capuchins and their Muslim

neighbors became cordial. The father accosted in the street, for example, was

cared for by a ‘‘Turk of quality’’ who had the youth arrested. A contemporary dis-

patch reports that Ottoman-Muslims ‘‘embrace us, come to eat with us, and want

especially to observe our rites, such as keeping silence, reading while eating . . .

They listen to our vespers in the choir where we sing, and they say that they love

us so much that if any movement against Christians were to arise, we would not

experience a shadow of evil.’’∞π≥ When the Church of Santa Maria in Constantino-

ple was in danger of being closed by Ottoman o≈cials, ‘‘all the Turkish women

neighbors of the church’’ took to the streets shouting ‘‘we do not want anything

bad done, or that any trouble be given this church.’’∞π∂

Of particular acclaim throughout Constantinople was the tiny, ancient church

"
202,"182

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

of San Antonio Abbate, which attracted ‘‘a universal and indistinct crowd of

people, who ﬂock there for its favors, . . . Latins, Greeks, Armenians, and the

Turks themselves.’’ The crowds made o√erings in the range of six to seven hun-

dred ducats annually. People were drawn because of the miraculous healings

associated with the church, which at times became crowded with people ‘‘making

vows for the sick, as in Christendom is done at Our Lady of Loreto, or Liège.’’

Christians and Muslims would sleep in the church and listen to mass in the hopes

of being healed. One papal visitor reported in 1622 that twenty-six men and

women were sleeping in the church during his visit, and he claimed that one of

the sultan’s daughters had once slept in the miraculous church, though this

seems highly improbable. The city’s insane were brought, ‘‘their relatives allow-

ing them to be tied and placed in irons, and if necessary beaten,’’ in the hope they

would be cured of their condition.∞π∑

Because of the importance of ritual ablutions in Islam, Muslims were espe-

cially attracted to the waters of San Antonio’s well, which they viewed as holy and

which they drank and even washed in during the winter. They would also ‘‘come

bearing o√erings of lamps, candles, money, and other things to the Cordelier

monk who is there, throwing themselves on their knees at his feet, praying him to

recount to them the Gospel of Saint John or about the feast of Saint Anthony on

the roof, with the star, as do the women in Christendom. And what is wonderful

about the bounty of God, is that without regard to their inﬁdelity, he cures them

miraculously.’’∞π∏ Also enjoying a miraculous reputation among both Christian

and Muslim was the small chapel in the kapudanpa¸sa’s slave quarters. It was

widely believed that whoever slept there three nights in a row would be healed of

all inﬁrmities.∞ππ

One Muslim woman, whose hands were rheumatic, had been to a number of

dervishes and Islamic ‘‘holy men’’ to no avail. She visited San Antonio, where a

priest read a gospel over her head, and when he said Verbum caro factum est, her

hands were healed, and she publicized throughout the city that she had been

cured ‘‘by the Christians’ law.’’∞π∫ A Papal emissary in Constantinople attempted

to explain the healing of the inﬁdel woman thus: ‘‘Though they too receive on

their heads these orations, they do not feel by this that they are doing anything

against their belief because, beyond the fact that they believe in the Gospel, they

told me additionally . . . that this Saint fulﬁlled them because he had been a

Muslim, that is a Turk, and had believed in Muhammed, and . . . these opin-

ions are of the vulgar masses and not of their wise men, who in encountering

them pretend not to know of these miracles, or search for opportunities to ﬁnd in

them insidiousness.’’∞πΩ The distinct divisions that scholars and theologians, both

"
203,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

183

Christian and Muslim, drew between their respective faiths, in practice were

much more ﬂexible and overlapped in the minds of the masses. Saints could be

venerated as Christian or their religious identity adapted to popular beliefs, and in

either case divine favor might be obtained. Indeed, the imperial ambassador

Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq in the mid-sixteenth century reported, ‘‘I have known

instances of Turks who had their children secret ly baptised; their notion being

that there must be some advantage in this rite, or otherwise it would never have

been instituted.’’∞∫≠

Examples of similar syncretic practices abound in the early modern Mediterra-

nean.∞∫∞ During his 1553 mission, the Venetian diplomat Catarino Zeno visited the

Orthodox monastery of Milesevo and reported witnessing both Muslims and Jews

who came to hear prayers read by the monks and o√ered alms in return, often in

greater numbers than Christian pilgrims. In Bosnia, Catholic monks ‘‘enjoyed a

high reputation for exorcism of evil spirits, and they were often asked by in-

dividual Muslims or even the Ottoman authorities to perform the ritual.’’∞∫≤ In

Spain, Muslims and Christians shared popular beliefs in Bible tales, ‘‘demons and

angels, heaven and hell,’’ and women from both religions shared in venerat-

ing Mary.∞∫≥

As a counterpoint to its spiritual attractions, Galata drew many more Muslims

‘‘who wished to enjoy themselves there à la franca.’’ Evliya Çelebi reported that

there were two hundred taverns and houses of debauchery in the city, concluding

that ‘‘to say Galata is to say taverns—may God pardon us!’’ Despite his alarm, he

seems to have known the area well and described its various wines and culinary

o√erings in detail.∞∫∂ A century earlier, Lâtifî described Galata as ‘‘the biggest

tavern in the world.’’∞∫∑ Foreign travelers observed much the same about Galata’s

night life: Thévenot reported, ‘‘The Greeks have many cabarets in Galata which

attract a good deal of the rabble of Constantinople.’’ The popularity of these

taverns led to their regular closure by the Ottomans in the di≈cult years from

1590 to 1640, as a reaction against and expiation for the sinfulness of the patrons.

Evliya Çelebi reports that there was an Ottoman o≈cial speciﬁcally assigned to

prevent riots and other troubles associated with the town’s taverns.∞∫∏

While Venetian patricians, merchants, and citizens might most often encoun-

ter Ottoman-Muslims at festivities, religious festivals, on the hunt, or in private

salons, commoners met regularly in everyday settings, especially in commerce

and industry. Particularly in the maritime industries, it was not at all uncommon

for men of all sorts to work side by side. In 1596, for example, a list of forty-six

carpenters who repaired a Venetian merchant ship included Slavs, Messinans,

Genoese, Neapolitans, French, Romans, Greeks, Germans, Puglians, Corsicans,

"
204,"184

v e n e t i a n s i n c o n s t a n t i n o p l e

Portuguese, Spaniards, Venetians, Rhodiots, and six Muslims. Caulkers working

on the same ship made up an equally diverse group.∞∫π This mix was not un-

common, as several other account books register similar work crews, and non-

Muslims were counted among the members of Constantinople’s many guilds,

especially those that traded and worked with European merchants. Muslim outﬁt-

ters also provided for the needs of the Venetian ships that came to the port.∞∫∫ It

was also very common for Muslim raìs to captain merchant ships on which non-

Ottomans served.∞∫Ω

Another common meeting ground, which warrants further research, was the

galleys, both Ottoman and European. In the case of the former, it appears that in

1611– 13 ‘‘Moslems were in the minority on their own ships,’’ with the majority of

the crews being made up of Christians. In addition to these ﬁelds of encounter,

individual Venetians might contract with Ottoman-Muslims to navigate the com-

plexities of the Porte, and instances of Muslims serving Venetian merchants as

cernitori, and the converse, were also not unheard of.∞Ω≠

Opportunities for encounters between the varied populations of Constanti-

nople were numerous, regular and highly diverse. Observers may have divided

the urban area into ethnic and religious quarters, but in fact Christians lived

alongside Muslims in many parts of the city. Interactions at the commercial,

political, social, and religious levels were experienced regularly in the varied

world of greater Constantinople, and claims that geographically proximate groups

lived within the same orbit but with their trajectories rarely crossing clearly ob-

scure the more vibrant reality of this complex community. Muslims, Christians,

Jews, Europeans, Ottomans, and Persians all lived and worked and celebrated

together in the Ottoman capital of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Their

interactions may have ﬂared during moments of stress, and in certain ways may

have been characterized by misperception and conﬂict, but more common were

the sorts of everyday exchanges described in this chapter.

This reality was made possible, at least in part, by the fact that individual and

group identities in this period were not rigid or monochromatic; identity was

more complex than a bipartite model of self and other. Behind labels such as

Venetian or Ottoman were groups and individuals possessed of more ambiguous

and adaptable identities. Individuals who interacted in Constantinople and other

cities of the Mediterranean deﬁned themselves along a spectrum of categories of

identity which might include geographical, social, familial, gender, cultural, reli-

gious, political, and other factors. Venice’s nation in Constantinople included

Venetians born, Venetians made, non-Venetians, Greek-Venetians, and even

Ottoman subjects. Venice’s baili were Christian and Venetian, but they were also

"
205,"a n u r b a n m i d d l e g r o u n d

185

diplomats and gent lemen, and they were thus able to develop relationships with

Ottoman-Muslims of similar standing based on their political and social iden-

tities. Muslim inhabitants of the city often shared similar conﬁdence in the mirac-

ulous properties of places or individuals with their Christian neighbors, and they

often interacted through work and trade and thus developed a shared sense of

community based on profession. Identities based on regional provenance and

familial relations were as important pieces of the puzzle of identity as faith or

polity, perhaps even more so. Although religion and political a≈liation were

certainly key, it is overly simple to try to essentialize or reduce the complexity of

early modern identities to a single category or two.

Individual and group identities were composites, constructed of concentric

circles or multiple layers. Additionally, identity was more than the sum total of its

various parts: it was malleable, instrumental, a dynamic process of negotiation

rather than a static, essentialized object. When we perceive the Mediterranean

world in these terms, and not in simple binary divisions that assume an in-

herent clash between civilizations, then the striking evidences of peace and co-

existence between peoples of diverse religious and cultural backgrounds can be

more readily understood, and may perhaps hold out some hope for our own

troubled times.

1. Venetian sources invariably refer to the Ottoman capital as Constantinople instead of

Istanbul. While Istanbul is preferred among Ottomanists, because the bulk of my archival

sources are Venetian and the primary focus is on the Venetian community, I have chosen to

adhere to the geographical terminology of the documentary record. On this, see Runciman,

‘‘Constantinople-Istanbul.’’

In early modern times this suburb was called Galata or Pera interchangeably; in this

study, however, I have favored Galata, which contemporary Venetian sources often used,

except when quoting from documents in which Pera is used. To further confuse the matter,

the Vigne di Pera was the area outside the walled city of Galata /Pera stretching along the

crest of the hill and was the location of all the ambassadorial residences. The Vigne di Pera

and Galata /Pera were clearly distinct areas in contemporaries’ minds. The modern quar-

ters of Beyo ˘glu and Karaköy correspond to the same area as early modern Galata. Pistarino,

67. Zachariadou, ‘‘Co-Existence and Religion,’’ 119–29. In Venice’s Greek possessions,

noble and commoner Venetian settlers intermarried with local Greeks, attended Orthodox

mass, and were known ‘‘to baptise their children, to marry and to bury their dead in

accordance with the Orthodox rite.’’ A report from 1602 states that ‘‘there is no quarrel on

matters of religion, since both communities live freely in their own rites, and the Greek

notables and others of their rite often go to Latin churches to hear mass, and the Latins

frequent the churches of the Orthodox. The clergy of both rites are respected by all.’’

According to this observer, St. Francis was venerated by Orthodox and Catholic alike.

1575. The baili occuppied a prominent position in the highly symbolic order of Venice’s

grand ducal processions. Following the doge, his six counselors, the Procuratori di San

Marco, the savi grandi, and the Council of Ten, came the ﬁve most important resident

ambassadors in Venice’s service, ‘‘Rome, Vienna, Madrid, Paris, and Constantinople.’’

meaning portatore; in practice it also meant reggitore or governatore (see for example, Dante,

30. There has been some debate on whether early Italian representatives such as the

bailo were consuls or ambassadors, indeed the Venetian Senate itself in 1574 felt it neces-

sary to legislate that baili were on equal footing with other ambassadors. By the end of the

sixteenth century, however, the importance and status of the baili were clearly established.

twenty-one, and perhaps as many as thirty-four, people. Among these were ‘‘a treasurer, a

surgeon, a chef, a wine steward, a pastry chef, a falconer, an astrologer, a groom, and a

Turkish dragoman’’; Biron, Ambassade en Turquie, 1:16– 19. The famiglia of the ﬁrst Dutch

attitudes such as that expressed by one patrician who preferred to travel to Constantinople

by land ‘‘to liberate myself from the Sea, [which is] totally contrary and dangerous to my

complexion,’’ SDC, b. 21, c. 168r, 23 Apr 1584, Lorenzo Bernardo to Senate from Ragusa.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Alvise Contarini who, in recommending several

changes in Venetian maritime practice, admitted ‘‘I have very little knowledge both of the

profession of merchant which I have never done, and of navigation which I have never

experienced’’; It VII 1085 (8522), cc. 222r–227v, 6 Feb 1637 (MV), Alvise Contarini to

18. Gullino, ‘‘I patrizi veneziani,’’ 415; Lane, Venice, 384. Tucci, ‘‘Psychology of the

Venetian Merchant,’’ 356, paints a bleaker picture; he shows a drop between 1500 and 1603

in patrician requests for state shipbuilding loans from 72.72% to 10.72%. This ignores,

however, ships patricians purchased from other Venetians and, even more importantly,

ships purchased outside of Venice, which were then granted Venetian status by the Senate.

The records of the V Savii contain a number of such investments: Francesco Morosini

bought four, perhaps ﬁve, foreign ships over a four-year span near the end of the century;

Benetto Dolﬁn in 1596 bought a ship constructed in Constantinople and had it armed in

Venice. VSM-I, reg. 139, c. 146v, 9 Jun 1597; cc. 167v– 168r, 27 Sep 1597; c. 135r, 27 Feb 1596

39. Gullino has proposed a suggestive explanation for patrician families’ reluctance to

send their sons to the Levant after 1550: for households that had titular land holdings,

commende, and trusts, the objective was not acquisition but conservation of wealth. The

"

chief way to ensure this was ‘‘through the continuity of the family, and [sending a son to the

Levante] constitute[d] perhaps an excessive and unjustiﬁed risk . . . Especially since trade

could also be exercised in the dominante.’’ Gullino, ‘‘I patrizi veneziani,’’ 414.

1617. The closure of the Black Sea to Italian, particularly Venetian, trade has been the

subject of some controversy. While earlier scholars dated this event to the early sixteenth

century, Gilles Veinstein has recently posited that the route did not close until the 1590s.

Venetian sources, however, make clear that while reduced, the Black Sea route was never

entirely closed, especially not to Greek-Venetian subjects. Veinstein, ‘‘From the Italians to

the Ottomans,’’ 229; Issawi, ‘‘The Ottoman Empire in the European Economy,’’ 107– 17;

The Venetians were convinced that it was a Jewish conspiracy that prevented them from

settling the matter. See BAC, b. 269, reg. 382, cc. 252v–253v, 254v–256r 1 Sep and 3 Sep

101. The question of why non-Venetians would want to trade with the nation is more

complex. In the case of Ludovici and others from areas that did not enjoy formal recogni-

tion in the Ottoman Empire, it was necessary to trade under the protection of a recognized

"
229,"n o t e s t o p a g e s 6 1 – 6 4

209

nation. The capitulations stipulated that this nation be the French, but merchants may have

been attracted to the Venetian because of the strength of its institutions and the inﬂuence of

its heads, particularly given the problems the French and English nations experienced in

this period.

The question of Ottoman subjects in the nation is more elusive. As subjects of the

sultan, the treaties extended them legal trading rights and privileges equivalent to those of

Venetian merchants: they paid the same tari√s and enjoyed, in theory at least, the protec-

tion of Venetian institutions. Perhaps Ottoman subjects were drawn to the Venetian nation

for similar reasons as their non-Ottoman co-commercialists. For more on this, see chapter

5 for a discussion of the Ottoman Piron family.

2. Paola Subacchi has shown that the situation among the Italian nations in Antwerp

was similar; only about 30 percent of the Italians working in that city belonged to the o≈cial

nation. ‘‘Below the top level of the community there were small and medium-size mer-

chants, craftsmen, agents and intermediaries and, generally, a crowd of people involved in

all sorts of jobs, trading and activities.’’ Subacchi, ‘‘Italians in Antwerp,’’ 78–83.

9. Muir suggests that banditi often applied to more than one Venetian magistracy in

attempts to have their sentences reduced. An audience before the bailo in Constantinople,

then, might have represented something of a court of last resort. Muir, Mad Blood Stir-

varying degrees of success. They seem to have had particular di≈culty with Gazanfer A ˘ga;

in Venetian reports his name is variously written as Giafer Aga, Gia√er Aga, Gasamfer Aga,

Casafer Aga.

relates an incident in which an opponent described Gazanfer A ˘ga as a ‘‘Frank by birth.’’

Naima, Annals, 1:91–92. Renegades in general seem to have been sensitive to their public

image vis-à-vis their native states. Çigalazade, for example, on whose seal was written

‘‘Champion of the faith on land and sea,’’ was attacked by an enemy vizier who ‘‘called him

an inﬁdel of the Muslim law, because having been with his mother, who was already a Turk,

and having her in his power, he did not bring her to Constantinople, as per the Muslim

precept.’’ The vizier tried to have the kapudanpa¸sa declared by the müfti an ‘‘inﬁdel having

gone against the Muhammedan religion in not conducting his mother here, who was

already a Turk, and that he was no longer a Muslim, and that he needed again to return and

become a Turk, and to raise the ﬁnger, which is the usual sign of renouncing.’’ Even earlier,
Süleyman’s favorite ˙Ibrahim was detested by the military and civil bureaucrats because of

his unorthodox rise to power and his supposed sympathy for Christianity, resulting in the
sacking of his palace in 1525 by the janissaries while ˙Ibrahim was in Egypt putting down a

revolt. Rinieri, Clemente VIII e Sinan Bassà Cicala, 20– 31; SDC, b. 55, cc. 23r–27v, 13 Mar

929 / 1523 made Ibrahim Pasha, a palace favourite, Grand Vezir in deﬁance of the old

system . . . The withdrawal of the Sultan and the denigration of the Grand Vezir left the way

open to the pernicious regime of palace favourites-of women, eunuchs, hangers-on, spec-

93. An interesting postscript is the request in 1615 of Stefano Piron for ‘‘the defense

and protection [that Venice o√ers] to those that confess their devotion to the Most Serene

Republic.’’ In support of this request, he pointed to his dealings in Venice, his regular

payment of the cottimi, and the fact that he had ‘‘never utilized Turkish justice with another

subject [of Venice].’’ Stefano’s motivation for this request is illuminating: he wanted ‘‘to free

myself from diverse Turkish avanie, and from many travails.’’ ‘‘Have a commandment

created,’’ Piron continues, ‘‘in which it is expressed and declared that I may be defended by

Your Illustriousness and by every other most excellent Bailo from Turkish molestations and

avanie in a just way, as are defended others in this land, servants of the household of the

Most Excellent Baili, so that while enjoying this beneﬁt and grace I may, with security that I

will not be troubled in extraordinary matters by the Turks, continue and amplify my trade to

the beneﬁt of the customs of your Serenity and to the utility of this cottimo.’’ BAC, b. 317,

signiﬁcant quantities from Cyprus since the fourteenth century. Lane contends that until at

least 1600 Venice had no competition in supplying cotton to Europe. Lane, Venice, 298;

Luzzatto, Storia economica di Venezia, 47; see also the 1358 document cited in Lopez and

Raymond, Medieval Trade, 129. While certainly Venice was a key ﬁgure in this trade, the

involvement of Ca’fer suggests that Ottoman merchants were also actively involved. For
